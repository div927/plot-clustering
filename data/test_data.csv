610,Indru Netru Naalai,In the year 2065 a scientist (Arya) invents a time machine. To prove its capability he sends it back in time to 2015 programming it to return within forty seconds. However the machine does not return.The time machine is seen by three people in 2015 — Elango (Vishnu) a budding entrepreneur whose ideas are rejected by all and who is struggling to maintain his relationship with his rich girlfriend Anu (Miya) who is embarrassed at the fact that Elango is unemployed; Elango's best friend Pulivetti Arumugam (Karunakaran) a fake astrologer; and an inventor Giridhara Parthasarathy (T. M. Karthik) who makes a living by repairing home appliances. The three of them are involved in an accident and witness the time machine while recovering from the shock. While Parthasarathy decides to keep the time machine for himself he suffers an electric shock and ends up in a coma prompting Elango and Arumugam come to steal the time machine from Parthasarathy's shop. The duo use the time machine to make Arumugam's astrology practice extremely successful by going back in time and finding things lost by people under the guise of astrology. Elango further uses the machine to impress Anu's industrialist father Rajarathinam (Jayaprakash) by going to the future obtaining the stock market results and successfully predicting them in front of Rajarathinam and his company's board of directors. Rajarathinam soon approves the marriage of Anu with Elango.Things go smoothly until Elango and Arumugam inadvertently thwart an encounter to kill Kuzhandaivelu (P. Ravi Shankar) a dreaded gangster and extortionist who is targeting Rajarathinam during one of their trips to the past to find yet another item of one of Arumugam's clients.

Elango and Anu's marriage is postponed indefinitely as a result.Elango and Arumugam go back to the past to fix their mistake but Kuzhandaivelu accidentally shoots the time machine while fighting a police officer during the encounter damaging it. The duo find Parthasarathy who has woken up from his coma but doesn't remember them and ask him to fix the time machine. While Parthasarathy manages to fix the time machine due to a lack of specific parts which have not yet been developed it can only take the user to a specific time in the past (when Kuzhandaivelu damaged the time machine) and also as the date cannot be changed the user cannot return to the future. Therefore the duo decide not to use it. Later Kuzhandaivelu spots Elango Arumugam and Anu at a mall and pursues them. He opens fire during the chase killing Anu. To ensure that Anu remains alive Elango decides to use the time machine to return to the past and kill Kuzhandaivelu even though he cannot return. But Kuzhandaivelu spots the duo and while fighting them all three of them fall into the time machine and go to the past. In the past Kuzhandaivelu destroys the time machine but Elango manages to kill Kuzhandaivelu. Then Elango and Arumugam stop themselves from finding the time machine by thwarting the accident involving them and Parthasarathy.The next morning Elango wakes up in a bed remembering only the events of the previous night. He soon finds out to his surprise that he is in a marriage hall and that he is getting married to Anu on that day. He does not remember to Anu's bewilderment any of the events which had occurred in the past two months as a result of his usage of the time machine during that period. He finds out that without finding the time machine he got a job and managed to impress Rajarathinam with one of his business ideas leading to his marriage with Anu. Arumugam who also doesn't remember anything over the past two months is happily married. Elango and Arumugam soon find out that Kuzhandaivelu had died two months ago. They also run into Parthasarathy who does not recognise them as they had never met.Since the time machine was never seen it returned to 2065 making it a success.

1007,Never Let Me Go,The film begins with on-screen captions explaining that a medical breakthrough in 1952 has permitted the human lifespan to be extended beyond 100 years. It is narrated by 28-year-old Kathy H as she reminisces about her childhood at a boarding school called Hailsham as well as her adult life after leaving the school. The film first depicts the young Kathy along with her friends Tommy and Ruth spending their childhood at Hailsham in 1978. The students are encouraged to create artwork and their best work gets into The Gallery run by a mysterious woman known only as Madame. One day a new teacher Miss Lucy quietly informs the students of their fate: they are destined to be organ donors and will die or complete in their early adulthood. Shortly afterward she is fired by the headmistress Miss Emily for sharing this revelation with the children. As time passes Kathy falls in love with Tommy but Ruth and Tommy begin a relationship and stay together throughout the rest of their time at Hailsham.In the second act Kathy Ruth and Tommy now teenagers are rehoused in cottages on a farm in 1985. They are permitted to leave the grounds on day trips but are resigned to their eventual fate. At the farm they meet former pupils of schools similar to theirs and it is revealed that they are all clones. They also hear rumours of the possibility of deferral—a temporary reprieve from organ donation for donors who are in love and can prove it. Tommy becomes convinced that The Gallery at Hailsham was intended to look into their souls and that artwork sent to The Gallery will be able to confirm true love where it is present. The relationship between Tommy and Ruth becomes sexual and jealousy causes Kathy and Ruth to break their friendship. The lonely Kathy leaves and becomes a carer—a donor who is given a temporary reprieve from donation as a reward for supporting and comforting donors as they are made to give up their organs. Tommy and Ruth's relationship ends.In 1994 Kathy is still working as a carer and has watched many donors gradually die as their organs are harvested. Kathy who has not seen Ruth or Tommy since the farm discovers Ruth frail after two donations. They find Tommy who is also weakened by his donations and they take a drive to the seashore where Ruth admits that she did not love Tommy and only seduced him because she was afraid to be alone. She is consumed with guilt and has been searching for a way to help Tommy and Kathy. She believes that the rumours of deferral are true and has found the address of the gallery owner Madame who she thinks may grant deferrals to couples in love. Ruth dies on the operating table shortly afterward.Kathy and Tommy finally begin a relationship. Tommy explains to Kathy that he has been creating art in the hope that it will aid deferral. He and Kathy drive to visit Madame who lives with the headmistress of Hailsham. The two teachers tell them that there is no such thing as deferral and that Tommy's artworks will not help him. They explain that the purpose of The Gallery was not to look into their souls but to investigate whether the all but human donors even have souls at all; Hailsham was the last place to consider the ethical implications of the donor scheme. As they take in the news on their return journey Tommy explodes in rage and frustration and they cling to each other in grief. Tommy completes his final donation and dies on the operating table leaving Kathy alone waiting for her donations to begin in a month. Contemplating the ruins of her childhood she asks in voice-over whether her fate is really any different from the people who will receive her organs; after all we all complete.

1202,Riddick,Five years after Kyra's death Riddick has become increasingly uneasy in his role as Lord Marshal of the Necromonger fleet. His refusal to swear into the Necromonger faith has caused dissent among his subjects and assassination attempts by his subordinates. After the latest attempt on his life Riddick strikes a deal with Commander Vaako: the location of Furya and a ship to take him there in exchange for Vaako succeeding him as the next Lord Marshal so that he can achieve what he calls transcendence. Led by Vaako's aide Krone Riddick and a group of Necromongers arrive on a desolate planet. Realizing that it is not Furya Riddick kills most of his escort when they attempt to assassinate him. In the chaos Krone causes a landslide and buries Riddick alive.Riddick emerges from the rubble with a broken leg which he sets and splints while fending off native predators: vulture-like flying animals packs of hyena-like beasts and swarms of venomous scorpion-like water-dwelling creatures called Mud Demons. Needing time to heal Riddick hides himself within some abandoned ruins. After he's fully healed Riddick notices a vast savanna beyond some rocky cliffs but the only passage through is impeded by several muddy pools infested with Mud Demons. He begins injecting himself with Mud Demon venom in order to build an immunity and constructs improvised melee weapons as well as raising and training an orphaned hyena-beast pup. He kills the Mud Demons and reaches the savanna. After finding a dormant mercenary station Riddick notices a series of approaching storms and concludes they will unleash an unidentified threat. Riddick activates an emergency beacon at the station which broadcasts his identity to mercenary groups within the area.Two mercenary crews promptly arrive in answer to the beacon. The first a barbaric group led by violent and unstable Santana and consisting of second-in-command Diaz preacher Luna and hunters Falco Rubio Vargas and Nunez. The second a team of professional mercenaries; leader Colonel R. Boss Johns second-in-command and marksman Dahl tracker Lockspur and gunner Moss. Riddick leaves them a message promising they will all die unless they leave one of their ships and depart the planet on the other. Rubio Nunez and Falco are killed by Riddick during the first night forcing a reluctant Santana to cooperate with Johns' team. Riddick later steals power nodes from each of the teams' ships and approaches Johns and Santana to strike a deal for their return. However the conversation turns into an ambush as Dahl shoots Riddick with several rounds of horse tranquilizer and Riddick's hyena-beast is shot and killed by Santana.Back at the Station Johns interrogates Riddick about the fate of his son William J. Johns. When the storms reach the station Riddick's threat is revealed as thousands of Mud Demons emerge from hibernation underground awakened by the rainwater and besiege the station killing Lockspur and Moss. Johns agrees to release Riddick in order to locate the hidden power cells but Santana attempts to kill Riddick because he is worth twice as much dead as he is alive and because Riddick promised to kill Santana within five seconds if set free. Riddick with only one leg free beheads Santana with his own machete with Dahl remarking that was five seconds. The group then releases Riddick on the condition he retrieve the nodes and each party gets a ship.They fight their way to the ships however Vargas is killed by a Mud Demon. Johns Diaz and Riddick leave the ship together on the hover-bikes to retrieve the power nodes. During their journey Diaz knocks Johns' bike over the side of an embankment causing him to crash. He is then picked up by Riddick. After they reach the power nodes Riddick reveals Johns' son's morphine addiction as well as his attempt to utilize a child as bait for the creatures. Diaz attempts to kill Riddick and Johns but Riddick fights and kills him however as Diaz dies he shoots and disables the last hover bike having already sabotaged the other.Riddick and Johns fend off a seemingly endless horde of Mud Demons while running back to the station. Riddick is severely wounded and Johns takes both nodes and abandons him. Riddick begins to fight a futile battle against the advancing Demons whilst climbing a rock spire. Just when it seems he is about to be killed Johns arrives in a repowered ship and shoots the creatures while Dahl descends to rescue Riddick. Giving him the other ship Johns asks Riddick where he intends to go before deciding he is better off not knowing. Riddick praises Johns for being a better man than his son and departs into deep space.In an alternate ending used only in the director's cut Riddick returns to Helion Prime and demands Vaako's whereabouts to Krone. Krone replies that Vaako 'kept his word' as he was a true Necromonger. Riddick then looks out to the vast galaxy with Vaako's words echoing to the audience Transcendence.

1223,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,Ten years after the global pandemic of the deadly ALZ-113 virus later called the Simian Flu the worldwide human population has been drastically reduced by more than 90% with only about one in 500 genetically immune to the virus. Countries have declared martial law and fragmented into military settlements. Meanwhile the apes under the chimpanzee Caesar all bestowed with genetically enhanced intelligence by the virus have long established a colony in the Muir Woods near San Francisco.One day a group of humans led by a man named Malcolm enter the apes' territory from San Francisco in search of a hydroelectric dam that would restore power to the city. An encounter by Caesar's son Blue Eyes and his friend Ash leads to the latter's injury by a man named Carver. Malcolm manages to prevent further escalation while Caesar orders the humans to leave. Prompted by Koba a scarred bonobo who holds a personal grudge against humans for his mistreatment as a test subject Caesar brings his army to the humans' community at an unfinished tower as a display of strength. Caesar announces his intent to fight the humans if forced to while demanding the humans to stay in their territory. Malcolm convinces his fellow leader Dreyfus to give him time to take a small team to the forest and reconcile with the apes so they can access the dam.

1228,The Day After Tomorrow,Jack Hall an American paleoclimatologist and his colleagues Frank and Jason drill for ice-core samples in the Larsen Ice Shelf for the NOAA when the ice shelf suddenly begins to split away. At a UN conference in New Delhi Jack discusses his research showing that climate change could cause an ice age but US Vice President Raymond Becker dismisses his concerns. Professor Terry Rapson an oceanographer of the Hedland Centre in Scotland befriends Jack over his views of an inevitable climate shift. When several buoys in the Atlantic Ocean show a severe ocean temperature drop Rapson concludes Jack's theories are correct. Jack's and Rapson's teams along with NASA meteorologist Janet Tokada build a forecast model based on Jack's research. Jack tries to get Becker to think about evacuations in the Northern States but Becker again ignores him.A massive storm system develops in the northern hemisphere splitting into three gigantic hurricane-like superstorms above Canada Scotland and Siberia. The storms pull frozen air from the upper troposphere into their center flash-freezing anything caught in their eyes with temperatures below -150 F. Meanwhile the weather worsens across the world: Tokyo is struck by a giant hail storm Nova Scotia has a 25 ft storm surge in seconds a three-helicopter special task force tasked with rescuing the British Royal family from Balmoral Castle crashes in Scotland after all their fuel lines freeze along with their crew and Los Angeles is devastated by a tornado outbreak. Following this President Blake issues an executive order for the FAA to ground all air traffic across the country but not before several crash.In New York City Jack's son Sam and his friends Brian Parks and Laura Chapman participate in an academic decathlon where they meet a new friend JD. New York is soon caught in the North American storm and the weather becomes progressively more violent resulting in street flooding and eventually a massive tsunami-like storm surge inundating Manhattan. This forces Sam's group to seek shelter at the New York Public Library but not before Laura accidentally cuts her leg. While cellphone communications are down Sam is able to contact Jack and his mother Lucy a physician through a working payphone; Jack advises him to stay inside and promises to rescue him. Rapson and his team perish in the European storm while Lucy remains in a hospital caring for bed-ridden children where she and her patients are eventually rescued by the authorities.Upon Jack's suggestion Blake orders the southern states to be evacuated into Mexico; the northern half is doomed to be hit by the superstorm but are warned by the government to seek shelters and stay warm. The Mexicans initially close the border but reopen it after Blake negotiates. With the storm having reached Washington Blake perishes after his motorcade is caught in it making Becker the new President. Jack Jason and Frank make their way to New York against all odds. In Pennsylvania Frank falls through the skylight of a mall that had become covered in snow and sacrifices himself by cutting his rope to prevent his friends from falling in after him. In the library most survivors as well as those from other structures decide to head south once the floodwater outside freezes in spite of Sam's warnings and are later found fatally frozen by Jack and Jason; only a few survivors end up heeding Sam's advice to stay put burning books to stay warm as the temperatures plunge.Laura develops blood poisoning from her injury whereupon Sam Brian and JD scour a Russian cargo vessel that had drifted into the city for penicillin fending off a pack of wolves which had escaped from Central Park Zoo. The eye of the North American storm arrives freezing Manhattan solid but Sam's group make it inside just in time. Likewise Jack and Jason take shelter in an abandoned restaurant. Days later the superstorms dissipate as Jack and Jason successfully reach the library finding Sam's group alive. Jack then sends a radio message to US forces in Mexico.Becker in his first address as president from the US embassy in Mexico apologizes on The Weather Channel for his ignorance admits his mistake and sends helicopters to rescue survivors in the Northern States. Jack and Sam's group are picked up in Manhattan where many people have survived. On the International Space Station astronauts look down in awe at Earth's transformed surface now with ice sheets extending across the northern hemisphere.
1229,Prometheus,As a spacecraft departs a planet a humanoid alien drinks an iridescent liquid causing its body to dissolve. Its remains cascade into a waterfall and the alien's DNA falls apart and recombines.In 2089 archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway discover a star map in Scotland that matches others from several unconnected ancient cultures. They interpret this as an invitation from humanity's forerunners the Engineers. Peter Weyland the elderly CEO of Weyland Corporation funds an expedition aboard the scientific vessel Prometheus to follow the map to the distant moon LV-223. The ship's crew travels in stasis while the android David monitors their voyage. Arriving in December 2093 mission-director Meredith Vickers informs them of their mission to find the Engineers and not to make contact without her permission.The Prometheus lands on the barren mountainous surface near a large artificial structure which a team explores. Inside they find stone cylinders a monolithic statue of a humanoid head and the decapitated corpse of a large alien thought to be an Engineer; Shaw recovers its head. The crew finds other bodies leading them to surmise that the species is extinct. Crew members Millburn and Fifield grow uncomfortable with the discoveries and attempt to return to Prometheus but become stranded in the structure when they get lost. The expedition is cut short when a storm forces the crew to return to the ship. David secretly takes a cylinder from the structure while the remaining cylinders begin leaking a dark liquid. In the ship's lab the Engineer's DNA is found to match that of humans. David investigates the cylinder and the liquid inside. He intentionally taints a drink with the liquid and gives it to the unsuspecting Holloway who had stated he would do anything for answers. Shortly after Shaw and Holloway have sex.Inside the structure a snake-like creature kills Millburn and sprays a corrosive fluid that melts Fifield's helmet. Fifield falls face-first into a puddle of dark liquid. When the crew returns they find Millburn's corpse. David separately discovers a control room containing a surviving Engineer in stasis and a large 3D holographic star map highlighting Earth. Meanwhile Holloway sickens rapidly. He is rushed back to Prometheus but Vickers refuses to let him aboard and at his urging burns him to death with a flamethrower. Later a medical scan reveals that Shaw despite being previously infertile is now in advanced pregnancy. Fearing the worst she uses an automated surgery table to extract a squid-like creature from her abdomen. Shaw then discovers that Weyland has been in stasis aboard Prometheus. He explains that he wants to ask the Engineers how to prevent his death from old age. As Weyland prepares to leave for the structure Vickers addresses him as Father.A monstrous mutated Fifield returns to the Prometheus and kills several crew members before he is killed. The Prometheus ' captain Janek speculates that the structure was an Engineer military base that lost control of a virulent biological weapon the dark liquid. He also determines that the structure houses a spacecraft. Weyland and a team return to the structure accompanied by Shaw. David wakes the Engineer from stasis and speaks to him in Proto-Indo-European to try to explain what Weyland wants. The Engineer responds by decapitating David and killing Weyland and his team before reactivating the spacecraft. Shaw flees and warns Janek that the Engineer is planning to release the liquid on Earth convincing him to stop the spacecraft. Janek and the remaining crew sacrifice themselves by ramming the Prometheus into the alien craft ejecting the lifeboat in the process while Vickers flees in an escape pod. The Engineer's disabled spacecraft crashes onto the ground killing Vickers. Shaw goes to the lifeboat and finds her alien offspring is alive and has grown to gigantic size. David's still-active head warns Shaw that the Engineer is pursuing her. The Engineer forces open the lifeboat's airlock and attacks Shaw who releases her alien offspring onto the Engineer. It thrusts an ovipositor down the Engineer's throat subduing him. Shaw recovers David's remains and with his help launches another Engineer spacecraft. She intends to reach the Engineers' homeworld in an attempt to understand why they wanted to destroy humanity.In the lifeboat an alien creature bursts out of the Engineer's chest.

1234,The Day the Earth Stood Still,In 1928 a solitary mountaineer exploring the Karakoram mountains in India encounters a glowing sphere. He loses consciousness and when he wakes the sphere has gone and there is a scar on his hand where a sample of his DNA has been taken.In the present day a rapidly moving object is detected beyond Jupiter's orbit and forecast to impact Manhattan. It is moving at 30000 kilometers per second fast enough that its impact would destroy all life on Earth. The United States government hastily assembles a group of scientists including Helen Benson and her friend Michael Granier to develop a survival plan.The scientists travel to New York City to await for the object's collision with Earth. As it nears the planet the object slows down just before impact. Revealed to be a large spherical spaceship it lands gently in Central Park and is quickly surrounded by NYPD and heavily armed US military forces. An alien emerges and Helen moves forward to greet it; but amidst the confusion the alien is shot. A gigantic humanoid robot appears and temporarily disables everything in the vicinity by emitting a high pitched noise before the wounded alien voices the command Klaatu barada nikto to shut down the robot's defensive response.The alien's exterior is found to be a bioengineered space suit composed of placenta-like material covering a human-like being. After the bullet is extracted during surgery the being quickly ages into Klaatu who looks like the mountaineer from 1928. Klaatu informs Secretary of Defense Regina Jackson that he is a representative of a group of civilizations sent to talk to the leaders of Earth about saving the planet. When Jackson instead sends him to be interrogated Klaatu escapes and reconnects with Helen and her stepson Jacob telling them that he must finish his mission to save the Earth.The presence of the sphere and other smaller spheres that begin to appear all over the world cause widespread panic. The military launches a drone attack on the Central Park sphere but is thwarted by the robot. The military takes a weapons-free approach cautiously enclosing the robot soon nicknamed GORT (for Genetically Organized Robotic Technology) and transporting it to the Mount Weather underground facility in Virginia.Klaatu meets with another alien Mr. Wu who has lived on Earth for 70 years. Wu tells Klaatu that he has found the human race to be destructive stubborn and unwilling to change which matches Klaatu's experiences. Klaatu orders the smaller spheres to collect specimens of animal species to preserve them for later reintroduction to the Earth. He clarifies for Helen that he means to save the Earth from destruction by humankind. When a New Jersey State Trooper attempts to take them into custody Klaatu kills him then promptly revives the officer telling Helen and Jacob that he did this to simply disarm an obstacle to his mission.Hoping to persuade Klaatu to change his mind about humanity Helen takes him to the home of Professor Barnhardt a Nobel Prize winner. They discuss how Klaatu's race went through drastic collaborative evolution to prevent the demise of their planet. Barnhardt pleads that Earth is at the same precipice and humanity should be given a chance to understand that it too must change. While the adults are talking Jacob calls the authorities to come and arrest Klaatu.While the military is examining GORT the robot transforms into a swarm of winged insect-like nano-machines that self-replicate as they consume every man-made object in their path. The swarm soon devours the entire facility emerging above ground to continue feeding.The military captures Helen while Klaatu and Jacob escape on foot. As they travel Klaatu learns more about humanity through Jacob. When Jacob contacts Helen and arranges to meet at his father's grave the Secretary sends her to try to change Klaatu's mind. At the grave Jacob is heartbroken that Klaatu cannot resurrect his long-dead father. As Helen and Jacob have a tear-filled reunion Klaatu's cumulative observations of humans convince him to stop the swarm.Granier drives them to the Central Park sphere but the swarm has reached massive proportions. Klaatu trudges through the swarm to the sphere touching it moments before his own body is consumed. The sphere deactivates the swarm saving humanity but at the expense of electrical activity on Earth per Klaatu's warning that there will be a price to the human way of life. The giant sphere leaves the Earth.

A chestburster with traits of both species erupts from Scar's body. It quickly matures into an adult Predalien and starts killing the Predators on board (in the extended cut this happens on a scout ship that has been detached from the mother ship). A Predator's weapon punctures the hull and the ship crashes in the forest outside of Gunnison Colorado killing all but one of the Predators who is severely injured and sends a distress signal before being killed by the Predalien.The Predalien and several facehuggers escape implanting embryos into a nearby father and son who are out hunting in the forest as well as several homeless people who live in the sewers. On the Predator homeworld a skilled veteran Predator Wolf receives the signal and takes it upon himself to travel to Earth to hunt and kill Xenomorphs. He arrives at the crashed Predator ship uses a blue acid-like liquid to dissolve and erase evidence of Xenomorphs' presence and triggers an implosion to completely destroy the vessel.Meanwhile ex-convict Dallas Howard has just returned to Gunnison after serving time in prison. He is greeted by Sheriff Eddie Morales and reunites with his younger brother Ricky. Ricky has a romantic interest in his classmate Jesse but is constantly harassed by her boyfriend Dale and his two friends. Kelly O'Brien has also just returned to Gunnison after serving in the US Army's 101st Airborne Division and reunites with her husband Tim and daughter Molly. Darcy Benson the wife of the killed father begins searching for her missing husband and son. Meanwhile local waitress Carrie Adams discovers she is pregnant but her police officer husband Ray is killed by Wolf after witnessing him dissolving the bodies of Darcy's husband and son while he was searching for them in the forest. Wolf skins his corpse and hangs him upside down from a tree branch for sport.Wolf tracks several Xenomorphs in the sewer and defeats two of them but as the battle reaches the surface four disperse into the town. Wolf pursues some to the power plant where collateral damage from his dual plasma-caster weapons causes a citywide power outage. Ricky and Jesse meet at the high school swimming pool but are interrupted by Dale and his cohorts just as the power goes out and a Xenomorph enters the pool area killing Dale's friends. Another Xenomorph invades the O'Brien home killing Tim while Kelly escapes with Molly. After the fry cook at the local diner where Carrie works is attacked by Xenomorphs Carrie is also attacked after hearing the cook's screams and is impregnated by the Predalien with multiple chestbursters. Darcy discovers her body in horror but Sheriff Morales arrives and brings her with him.Kelly Molly Ricky Jesse Dale Dallas and Sheriff Morales gather at a sporting goods store to collect weapons. Troops from the Colorado Army National Guard arrive but are quickly slaughtered by Xenomorphs. Wolf briefly captures Dallas inside the store to use as bait to lure Xenomorphs but Dallas escapes. Several Xenomorphs arrive and Wolf handily defeats them. Dale is killed by a Xenomorph during the battle and one of Wolf's shoulder plasma-casters is damaged. He removes his remaining one and modifies it into a hand-held blaster.As the survivors attempt to escape Gunnison they make radio contact with Colonel Stevens and are told that an air evacuation is being staged at the center of town. Dallas and Kelly are skeptical since going there would cause them to become surrounded by Xenomorphs so they along with Ricky Jesse Molly and a few others go for the helicopter at the hospital to get out of town while Sheriff Morales and Darcy head to the evacuation zone. However the hospital has been invaded and overrun by Xenomorphs and the Predalien who has impregnated some pregnant women to breed more Xenomorphs by filling each with multiple fast growing embryos. Wolf soon arrives at the hospital where he dispatches more Xenomorphs and during the battle the Predator accidentally impales Jesse with one of his shuriken weapons. Distraught Ricky rushes Wolf with rifle fire only to be injured by the Predalien. The Predator is attacked by a Xenomorph and both tumble down an elevator shaft. Dallas takes possession of Wolf's plasma blaster.Dallas Ricky Kelly and Molly reach the roof and fight off several Xenomorphs before escaping in the helicopter while Wolf having survived the fall battles the Predalien on the roof in hand-to-hand combat. Wolf and the Predalien mortally wound each other just as a military jet arrives. Rather than a rescue mission the F-22 Raptor executes a tactical nuclear strike that levels the entire city instantly killing Sheriff Morales Darcy and everyone else gathered at ground zero. The shock wave causes the fleeing helicopter to crash in a clearing where the survivors are rescued by the military. Wolf's plasma blaster is confiscated and Colonel Stevens presents it to Ms. Yutani.

1239,Alien: Resurrection,Two hundred years after the events of Alien 3 United Systems Military scientists on the space vessel USM Auriga create a clone of Ellen Ripley designated Ripley 8 using DNA from blood samples taken before her death. The Xenomorph queen's DNA has been combined with Ripley's so the clone grows up with an embryo inside it. The scientists extract the embryo raise it and collect its eggs while keeping Ripley 8 alive for further study. As a result of the Xenomorphs' DNA inside her the clone has enhanced strength and reflexes somewhat acidic blood and a psychic link with the Xenomorphs. Additionally the Xenomorph's genetic memory allows the clone to have some of Ripley's memories.A group of mercenaries consisting of Elgyn Johner Christie Vriess Hillard and Call arrives at Auriga on their ship Betty. They deliver several kidnapped humans in stasis. The military scientists use the humans as hosts for the aliens raising several adult Xenomorphs for study.The Betty crew soon encounters Ripley 8. Annalee Call recognizes her name and tries to kill her suspecting that Ripley 8 may be used to create Xenomorphs but the creatures have already been cloned. The now mature Xenomorphs being aware of their blood's acidic properties from the aforementioned genetic memory escape confinement by killing off one of their own to use its acidic blood to burn through their enclosures. They then capture Dr. Jonathan Gediman and kill a second scientist. They damage the Auriga and kill some of those people who failed to evacuate including General Perez and Elgyn. Another crew member is captured and cocooned for eggmorphing. Military scientist Dr. Wren reveals that the ship's default command in an emergency is to return to Earth.

1242,Aliens,Ellen Ripley has been in stasis for 57 years in an escape shuttle after destroying her ship the Nostromo to escape a lethal alien creature which slaughtered her crew. She is rescued and debriefed by her employers at the Weyland-Yutani Corporation who are skeptical about her claim of alien eggs in a derelict ship on the exomoon LV-426 since it is now the site of the terraforming colony Hadley's Hope. After contact is lost with the colony Weyland-Yutani representative Carter Burke and Colonial Marine Lieutenant Gorman ask Ripley to accompany them to investigate. Still traumatized from her alien encounter she agrees on the condition they exterminate the creatures. Ripley is introduced to the Colonial Marines and an android Bishop on the spaceship Sulaco.A dropship delivers the expedition to the surface of LV-426 where they find the colony deserted. Makeshift barricades and battle signs are inside but no bodies; two live alien facehuggers in containment tanks and a traumatized young girl nicknamed Newt are the sole survivors. The crew locates the colonists beneath the fusion-powered atmosphere processing station and head to their location descending into corridors covered with alien secretions. At the center of the station the Marines find the cocooned colonists serving as incubators for the creatures' offspring. The Marines kill an infant alien after it bursts from a colonist's chest rousing multiple adult aliens who ambush the Marines and kill or capture many of them. When the inexperienced Gorman panics Ripley assumes command takes control of their armored personnel carrier and rams the nest to rescue Corporal Dwayne Hicks and Privates Hudson and Vasquez. Hicks orders the dropship to recover the survivors but a stowaway alien kills the pilots and it crashes into the station. The survivors barricade themselves inside the colony.Ripley discovers Burke ordered the colonists to investigate the derelict spaceship containing the alien eggs intending to profit by recovering them for biological weapon research. Before she can expose him Bishop informs the group the dropship crash damaged the power-plant cooling system; it will soon explode destroying the colony. He volunteers to reach the colony transmitter and remotely pilot the Sulaco 's remaining dropship to the surface.After falling asleep in the medical laboratory Ripley and Newt awaken to find themselves trapped with the two released facehuggers.

Detecting a transmission from a nearby moon the ship's computer Mother awakens the crew. Per company policy requiring any potential distress signal be investigated they land on the moon despite Parker's protests sustaining damage from its atmosphere and rocky landscape in the process. The engineers stay on board to effect repairs while Dallas Kane and Lambert head out to investigate. They discover the signal originates from a derelict alien ship and enter it losing communication with the Nostromo. Ripley deciphers part of the transmission determining it to be a warning but cannot relay this information to those on the derelict ship.Meanwhile Kane discovers a chamber containing hundreds of large egg-like objects. When he touches one a creature springs out breaks through his helmet and attaches itself to his face. Dallas and Lambert carry the unconscious Kane back to the Nostromo.

He expresses admiration for the creature's psychology unhindered by conscience or morality and taunts them about their chances of survival. Ripley cuts off his power; as they leave Parker incinerates him.The remaining crew decide to self-destruct the Nostromo and escape in the shuttle. However Parker and Lambert are ambushed and killed by the creature while gathering life-support supplies. Ripley initiates the self-destruct sequence but finds the alien blocking her path to the shuttle. She retreats and attempts unsuccessfully to abort the self-destruct. With no further options she makes her way to the shuttle and barely escapes as the Nostromo explodes.As Ripley prepares for stasis she discovers that the alien is aboard having wedged itself into a narrow space. She puts on a spacesuit and uses gas to flush the creature out. It approaches Ripley but before it can attack she opens an airlock door almost blasting the creature into space. It manages to hang on by gripping the frame. Ripley shoots it with a grappling hook but the gun catches as the airlock door closes tethering the alien to the shuttle. It pulls itself into an engine exhaust but Ripley fires the engines blasting the creature away into the depths of space. After recording the final log entry she places Jones (the cat) and herself into stasis for the trip back to Earth.

Thomas and other abandoned children are placed in a walled maze in a glade as part of its scientific testing.Years later shortly after being rescued from the Maze Thomas and the remaining Gladers (Teresa Newt Minho Frypan Jack and Winston) are taken to a facility run by Mr. Janson. He says that the facility is a safe haven protecting them from WCKD the Flare virus and the Cranks and provides them supplies. Under Mr. Janson's care they discover that they were not the only Gladers and that many more mazes were constructed aside from their own. Thomas becomes suspicious of Mr. Janson and investigates. With help from Aris the first maze survivor to arrive in the facility (from another maze) Thomas discovers that WCKD's leader Ava is still alive and that Mr. Janson is working for WCKD when they discuss experiments on the Immunes and that Janson has yet to find the Right Arm a resistance group in the mountains. The group including Aris escapes the facility to the deserted outside world the Scorch. Mr. Janson orders WCKD troops to track them down.The group arrives at an abandoned shopping mall and encounter the Cranks humans zombified by the Flare virus. Winston gets infected by one of them. When morning comes they find the city in ruins and the WCKD still searching for them. Winston's infection becomes worse which forces the others to let him kill himself to prevent his transformation. While crossing the desert the group takes shelter in abandoned facility as a deadly lightning storm hits nearly killing them all. Inside they discover that it is filled with chained Cranks. The group meets Brenda and Jorge who lead a dangerous band of survivors and have used the Cranks as guard dogs. Brenda and Jorge agree to take them to the Right Arm and abandon their group of survivors. Minutes later WCKD led by Janson storms the place only for the facility to be destroyed by Jorge's explosives. Thomas and Brenda are left behind as the rest escape with Jorge.

1374,Judge Dredd,By the 2080s much of Earth has become an uninhabitable wasteland. While some humans manage to survive in the barren Cursed Earth the majority of humanity resides in huge Mega-Cities with populations of tens of millions. To combat crime the traditional justice system has been replaced by a corps of Judges whose role combines those of police officer judge jury and executioner.In Mega-City One 2139 Joseph Dredd one of the most dedicated Street Judges assists first-year Judge Barbara Hershey in ending a block war.

Dredd is taken to a trial before a tribunal of Council Judges including Griffin and Chief Justice Fargo his mentor. Dredd is found guilty as his DNA is found on the bullets used to kill Hammond (a feature of the Lawgiver is imprinting the user's DNA on each bullet a fact apparently unknown by most Judges). To save Dredd Fargo steps down as Chief Justice and for his last request asks the Council to spare Dredd's life. Dredd is sentenced to life imprisonment while Fargo embarks on the long walk in which a retiring Judge ventures into the wasteland to bring law to the lawless.

Fargo arrives in time to save Dredd's life but Mean Machine Angel mortally wounds him. A dying Fargo reveals that Dredd and Rico are the result of the Janus project an experiment in genetic engineering intended to create the perfect Judge. Dredd deduces Rico framed him for the reporter's murder using their identical DNA. Believing Griffin is trying to reactivate the Janus project Fargo urges Dredd to stop him.In Mega-City One Rico terrorises the city and assassinates Judges in various ways.

1421,Babylon A.D.,In a dystopian 2027 Russian mobster Gorsky (Depardieu) hires the mercenary Toorop (Diesel) to bring a young woman known only as Aurora (Thierry) from Europe to New York City. Gorsky gives Toorop a variety of weapons and a subdermally implanted UN passport. Toorop the girl and her guardian Sister Rebeka (Yeoh) travel from the Noelite Convent in Kyrgyzstan to reach New York via Russia.Unlike in the technologically advanced U.S. war and terrorist activity have transformed Russia's cities into dangerous overpopulated slums. The stress of humanity's situation causes Aurora to act out in strange ways and display clairvoyance abilities. On one such occasion Aurora seemingly for no reason panics and runs from a crowded train station just before it explodes in a terrorist attack.The protagonists must also evade an unknown group of mercenaries claiming to have been sent by Aurora's supposedly dead father. Later they board a submarine that carries refugees to Canada. To avoid satellite detection the Captain of the submarine orders his crew to dive and he shoots some of the refugees still trying to get on board. Aurora infuriated by the loss of life operates the 30-year-old submarine without training. Sister Rebeka tells Toorop that Aurora could speak nineteen different languages by the age of two and always seems to know things she has never learned. Three months before leaving with Toorop she began acting differently. This occurred after a Noelite doctor administered a pill. The doctor told her to go to New York City and arranged for Toorop to escort them.After arriving in Alaska with help from Toorop's associate Finn (Strong) the protagonists are attacked by weaponized drones. Toorop manages to destroy all the drones but also gets wounded. These perils cause Finn to betray the group so Toorop shoots him dead.Once in Harlem a news broadcast about the bombing of the Kyrgyzstan convent causes the group to realize there is more going on than they know. The Noelites have become a major new salvationist religion which vast numbers of people cling to as the world spirals out of control. However in private meetings it is seen that their High Priestess (Charlotte Rampling) only desires power and uses invented miracles to court converts. Gorsky working for the Noelites had planted a tracking device in Toorop's passport and bombed the convent when he knew they were in the United States. The doctor who earlier saw Aurora examines her again in a hotel room. When he leaves Aurora reveals (without being told) that she is pregnant with twins despite being a virgin.Looking outside the hotel Toorop sees Gorsky's men and the Noelite group heavily armed and waiting for them on the street. The High Priestess calls Toorop and asks him to bring Aurora outside. Just before they take her away Toorop changes his mind and starts a firefight with the two groups to get the two women to safety. Gorsky's men fire guided missiles at Toorop that track his subdermal passport. Rebeka gets killed defending Aurora who in turn shoots Toorop saying I need you to live. Toorop's clinical death causes the guided missile to go off target (missing Toorop) and explode near Aurora instead; she inexplicably survives.Dr. Arthur Darquandier (Lambert Wilson) revives Toorop using advanced medical techniques but several of Toorop's body parts are replaced with cybernetics to undo the damage of being dead for over two hours. Darquandier explains that when Aurora was a fetus he implanted a supercomputer into her brain. It is also implied that the Noelite group had him create Aurora to become pregnant at a certain time to use her as a virgin birth. After she was born the Noelites hired Gorsky to kill Darquandier but he failed. Darquandier remained dead until he found his daughter in Russia with Toorop.Darquandier uses a machine to scan Toorop's memory to find out what Aurora said to him before and shortly after shooting him. In Toorop's memory Aurora tells Toorop to go home. Toorop and several of Darquandier's men leave the facility. En route to Darquandier's lab the High Priestess calls Gorsky and during their videocall Gorsky is killed by a nuclear missile launched at him by the High Priestess. The High Priestess confronts and kills Darquandier but Toorop has already escaped. Toorop goes to his old house in the forest finds Aurora and takes her to a hospital where 6 months later she dies after giving birth. Aurora was designed to breed not to live so her death after childbirth was preprogrammed. Toorop takes care of her two children.In a scene that is only present in the theatrical cut but was removed from the director's cut the twins are shown to be of different ethnicities one looking like Aurora and the other like Toorop.

1435,Independence Day Resurgence,Twenty years after the devastating interstellar war against alien invaders the United Nations has founded the Earth Space Defense (ESD) a global defense and research program that reverse-engineers alien technology and serves as Earth's early warning system against extraterrestrial threats. Civilization has been restored and relative peace among nations exists following the human race's victory over the aliens' attacks and major cities around the world including Washington D.C. were rebuilt and modernized with amalgamated technologies. After establishing Area 51 as its headquarters the ESD set up bases on the Moon Mars and Rhea and orbital defense satellites above Earth as fortifications against future invasions.ESD Director David Levinson meets with warlord Dikembe Umbutu and Dr. Catherine Marceaux in the African state Republique Nationale d'Umbutu. They travel to a landed alien saucer and discover that the aliens were drilling before them sending a distress signal to their homeworld prior to their defeat. It is revealed that people such as former U.S. President Thomas Whitmore Dr. Brackish Okun and Umbutu are telepathically linked to the aliens' collective consciousness following personal encounters and have visions of an unidentified spherical object.An unidentified spherical ship emerges from a wormhole near Earth's Moon. Despite objections from Levinson it is destroyed on the orders of the Security Council. Defying orders American pilots Jake Morrison and Charlie Miller then collect Levinson Marceaux Umbutu and U.S. federal controller Floyd Rosenberg on a space tug. They head for the wreckage in the Van de Graaff crater where they recover a large container. An alien mothership suddenly appears responding to the distress call and proceeds to destroy much of Earth's planetary defense systems before landing over the North Atlantic Ocean where it starts to drill down toward Earth's molten core for fuel that will destroy the planet in the process. Narrowly escaping death those on board the space tug avoided capture and return to Area 51.Whitmore Levinson and U.S. General Joshua Adams' groups interrogate one of the aliens held in captivity at Area 51's prison facility from the war. They learn that the aliens exist in a hivemind and that one of their colossal Queens is commanding the invasion. Levinson hypothesizes that if they kill the supervising Queen her forces will cease drilling and go dormant. An ESD aerial fleet led by Captain Dylan Hiller stages a counterattack but they are caught in a trap within the mothership leaving only a few survivors including Dylan Jake Charlie and fellow ESD lieutenant and Chinese pilot Rain Lao.In Area 51 Okun opens the rescued container and releases a giant white sphere of virtual intelligence. The sphere reveals that her mission is to evacuate survivors to a planet of refuge from worlds targeted by the aliens whom she calls Harvesters and unite them in an attack on the Harvesters' planet. In the mothership all surviving ESD pilots manage to escape by hijacking enemy craft; Dylan Jake Charlie and Rain navigate two Harvester fighters to pursue the Queen's personal ship which is heading to Area 51 to extract information from the sphere about the refugee planet.Knowing that the Harvester Queen has become aware of the sphere's location the ESD hides her in an isolation chamber and uses a decoy in Jake's space tug to lure the Harvester Queen's ship into a trap. Whitmore volunteers to pilot the transport ship on a suicide mission leading the Queen's ship into a trap before detonating a bomb thus destroying the enemy ship by sacrificing himself. However the Harvester Queen survives by using an energy shield and a battle breaks out. Initially the ESD soldiers' weapons cannot penetrate the Queen's shield but after the Harvester Queen lowers her shield to fire her own weapon a critical hit by Whitmore's daughter Patricia deactivates her shield. This allows Dylan's party which arrives just in time to kill her before she can take the sphere.With the Queen gone all the remaining alien fighters are rendered inactive while the mothership stops drilling and retreats to space. Okun reveals that the sphere has asked humanity to lead her resistance and has offered them new technology in preparation for a potential counterattack on the Harvesters' homeworld.

1474,Deja Vu,On Mardi Gras in New Orleans the ferry Senator Alvin T. Stumpf is carrying hundreds of U.S. Navy sailors and their families across the Mississippi River from their base to the city. Suddenly the ferry explodes and sinks killing 543 passengers and crew members.Special Agent Douglas Carlin (Denzel Washington) from the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is sent to investigate and discovers evidence of a bomb planted by a domestic terrorist. Arriving at the scene he meets with local investigators and FBI Special Agent Paul Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer) and informs them of his findings. He learns about and is invited to examine a partially burned body pulled from the river identified as Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton) which was reported to the authorities minutes before the explosion.Pryzwarra impressed with Doug's detective expertise asks him to join a newly formed governmental detective unit and investigate the bombing. Led by Dr. Alexander Denny (Adam Goldberg) they investigate the events before the explosion by using a program called Snow White which enables them to look into the past (4 days 6 hours 3 minutes 45 seconds 14.5 nanoseconds) in detail by (according to Pryzwarra) using several satellites to form a triangulated image of events. The system is limited in that they can only see past events once; there is no fast forwarding or rewinding although they can record what they see in the process. Convinced that Claire is a vital link Doug persuades them to focus on her. While the team observes Claire's past through Snow White the bomber calls her to talk about the SUV she advertised for sale. He does not buy her car but the Snow White team is able to trace the call and use video surveillance recordings to determine where he will be in 7 hours.Doug finds out that Snow White is actually a time window and can send inanimate objects into the past. Despite Denny's protests against tampering with the past Doug has the team send a note back to his past self with the time and place the bomber will be. Instead his partner Larry Minuti (Matt Craven) gets the note and is shot by the bomber while following up on it. The team attempts to follow the fleeing bomber who takes Minuti with him but he moves outside of Snow White's range. However Doug is able to follow him in the present using a specially equipped vehicle with a mobile Snow White unit. In the past the bomber takes Minuti to his bayou shack where he kills him and sets fire to his body. Still needing a vehicle big enough to hold the bomb the bomber goes to Claire's address kidnaps her and takes her car.Using a facial recognition system the ferry bomber is identified and taken into custody. He is revealed to be Carroll Oerstadt (Jim Caviezel) a mentally unstable patriot who began to resent the US Army and the US Marine Corps after they repeatedly refused his enlistment attempts because of his failed medical tests psychological tests. Considering the case closed the government shuts down the Snow White investigation. Despite the bomber's capture Claire and the ferry victims remain dead which unsettles Doug since he is convinced that the Snow White team can actually alter history. Doug persuades Denny to do one last experiment: send Doug to the past to save Claire and stop the bombing (a risky procedure since no living being has ever been sent back successfully). Doug survives the trip by being sent back to a hospital emergency room where they are able to revive him. He steals a gun and an ambulance and races to Oerstadt's shack just in time to stop Claire's murder while Oerstadt flees with the bomb. As Doug returns to Claire's home with her to treat a gunshot wound that he had received Doug realizes this is not the first time he has traveled in time to stop Oerstadt leaving many of the clues for himself that he would find in the future and suggesting that a previous version of Doug had failed.Doug and Claire go to the ferry. Doug boards to try to find and disarm the bomb but Oerstadt captures Claire and restrains her inside the vehicle in which he has placed the bomb. A brutal gunfight ensues hampered by Oerstadt's body armor before Doug distracts him using information he learned from his interrogation of the man in the future. While Oerstadt is distracted Claire rams him with the truck allowing Doug to finally kill him with a headshot. Doug attempts to free Claire but police surround them and threaten to open fire. Out of time Doug purposely drives the vehicle off the end of the ferry before it explodes saving the passengers. Claire swims free of the sinking car and is picked up by a rescue boat but Doug is unable to escape and dies in the subsequent underwater explosion.

1758,I Origins,A Ph.D. student Ian Gray is researching the evolution of the eye with research partner Kenny and first-year lab assistant Karen. At a Halloween party Gray encounters Sofi a young woman masked with only hazel-speckled ash-blue eyes visible. She later leads him into the washroom to have sex before abruptly leaving.Mysterious Synchronicities guide Gray to a billboard on which he recognizes Sofi's eyes. Eventually he sees her on a train. They begin a relationship although his rationalism clashes with her fey spirituality. One day they spontaneously agree to marry but must wait a day for a license. Disappointed they walk out of the registry office. Ian gets a call from Karen. She has found a blind worm—Eisenia fetida—with the DNA necessary to develop an eye. Ian takes Sofi to the lab with him.Karen leaves while Sofi is upset by the research they are doing. Ian accidentally splashes his eyes with formaldehyde. They call Karen who administers first aid. Sofi takes Ian home. On the way up Sofi's lower half is chopped off in an elevator accident.The film flashes forward seven years. Ian has written an eye evolution book and is now married to pregnant Karen. When their baby is born the hospital takes an iris scan of baby Tobias' eyes. The results are entered in the database and the program identifies the baby as a certain Paul Edgar Dairy. The nurse re-enters the results thinking it is a glitch and the problem disappears. A few months later a Dr. Simmons calls recommending further testing the baby. The test involves seemingly random photographs. Ian and Karen become suspicious. He tracks some pictures from the test to Idaho and the family of Paul Edgar Dairy who had died just before their baby was conceived.Kenny is now creator of the iris scan database used to store Tobias' scan and Kenny reveals that Dr. Simmons is in fact one of only five people with full access to the database. As a test he helps Ian and Karen run some photos of deceased family members plus various other people's eyes through the database to see if there are any other recent matches. They get a hit for Sofi whose iris scan matches one made in India just three months prior years after Sofi's death.Ian goes to India to find the subject of this scan an orphan girl named Salomina. With help from Priya Varma he spends weeks searching and putting up billboards. Eventually he finds the little girl staring at the billboard. He takes Salomina back to his hotel and contacts Karen over Skype. The two of them conduct a simple test designed to reveal if Salomina might be somehow linked with Sofi's memories. The results match the probable range of random chance. Feeling somewhat disheartened  Ian intends to take Salomina to Priya. But when they reach the elevator the moment the doors open Salomina panics and throws herself into his arms too frightened to enter. Staring into each other's eyes with a certain recognition they then cling to each other tears streaming down both their faces. He picks her up and takes her down the stairs instead with Salomina tightly gripping his neck till they walk from the dark interior and step out into the light.A post-credits scene shows Dr. Simmons scanning the irises of famous deceased figures finding many such matches.

2011,Ice Age: Collision Course,Some time after the events of the fourth film Manny and Ellie are preparing for the upcoming marriage between their daughter Peaches and her good natured fiancé Julian but Manny is unsure about the wedding. Diego and his wife Shira want to start a family but their fierce appearance tends to scare children. Sid  is about to propose to his fake girlfriend Francine but he is dumped by her and he laments his solitude. During Manny and Ellie's twenty-third wedding anniversary party asteroids (caused by Scrat who was propelled into outer space in an abandoned spaceship during an attempt to bury his acorn) strike the place and The Herd barely escape. Meanwhile at the underground lost world Buck returns a Chasmosaurus egg back to its rightful owner after it was stolen by a trio of flying dromaeosaurs named Gavin Gertie and Roger. Buck discovers an ancient stone pillar and takes it to the surface where he meets The Herd for the first time in years.Buck explains to The Herd that according to the pillar the asteroids had caused two extinctions of horseshoe crab-looking thingies and dinosaurs in the past and with the next one incoming he believes that the only place they could find a clue to stop it is on the site of the impact of the previous ones as according to its engravings they always fall in the same place. However the dromaeosaurs overhear their conversation and Gavin and Gertie decide to stop them believing that they could easily avoid the impact thus not only getting their revenge on Buck but also eradicating Earth's population and securing domination over the planet for their species. Roger is reluctant but Gavin and Gertie strong-arm him into cooperating.As The Herd travels to the crash site they discover that the asteroids have electro-magnetic properties. Buck theorizes that if a huge quantity of smaller asteroids should be gathered and launched into orbit they could attract the main asteroid as well and stop it. After facing several obstacles and the interference of the dromaeosaurs The Herd arrives at Geotopia a community of immortal animals formed inside one of the asteroids that have fallen long ago where Sid meets Brooke a female ground sloth who falls in love with him.However Shangri Llama the leader of Geotopia refuses to cooperate with Buck's plan to use the city's crystals in order to stop the asteroid as they are the key to the residents' longevity. Sid inadvertently destroys the entire city when he attempts to remove one of the crystals to present Brooke with immediately aging them to their real ages and revealing their true crone-like appearances much to Shangri Llama's anger.After convincing the Geotopians that stopping the asteroid is more important than their lost youth they and The Herd help with Buck's plan which is to fill up a volcano with the crystals so that the pressure launches them into space to draw the asteroid away. The dromaeosaurs attempt to intervene but they soon discover that they will not be able to survive the asteroid's impact and Buck convinces them to help. The plan initially fails as there is a small leak Granny discovers who uses her cane to plug it up causing an explosion which releases a massive electro-magnetic force that pulls the asteroid back into space.The Herd then departs back home including Sid who parts ways from Brooke but just after they leave a small crystal shard falls inside a hot spring giving it rejuvenating properties and making the Geotopians and Granny who stayed behind with them regain their youth. After The Herd returns Manny reconciles with Julian Peaches and Julian celebrate their wedding Diego and Shira become heroes to the kids who were scared of them before and a rejuvenated Brooke appears during the ceremony to reunite with Sid.

Anthony School on his first day while Peabody struggles to come to terms with Sherman's growing maturity as he fears of losing his bond with him. Sherman's knowledge of the apocryphal nature of the George Washington cherry-tree anecdote leads to a fight with one of his classmates a bossy girl named Penny Peterson in the cafeteria where she puts him in a choke hold accusing him of being a dog due to the fact that he was raised by Peabody. Peabody is called in by Principal Purdy as Sherman had bitten Penny in self-defense and also confronted by Ms. Grunion a Child Protective Services agent who suspects that Sherman's behavior is due to being raised by a dog and plans to visit to their home to investigate whether or not he is an unfit parent. Peabody invites Penny and her parents Paul and Patty over for dinner to reconcile before Ms. Grunion arrives. Penny calls Sherman a liar for claiming first-hand knowledge of history. Despite Peabody's contrary instructions Sherman shows Penny the WABAC to show proof and takes her into the past where she stays in Ancient Egypt in 1332 BCE to marry King Tut. Sherman returns to get Peabody's help. Peabody hypnotizes the Petersons and heads to Egypt to stop the wedding. Penny initially refuses to leave hoping to achieve Tut's riches after he dies until she is informed that she as well will be killed alongside Tut during the wedding and escapes with Peabody and Sherman.While trying to return the WABAC runs out of power so they stop at Renaissance Florence in 1508 where they meet Leonardo da Vinci and Lisa del Giocondo pioneering Mona Lisa's famous smile. Penny and Sherman explore da Vinci's attic and find his flying machine. Penny goads Sherman into flying it which he manages to do before crashing.

Peabody saves them but seemingly dies during the attempt causing Sherman to break down in tears while Penny comforts him.Feeling bad for his actions Sherman decides to go home and pilots the WABAC to a few minutes before they left in the present to get Mr. Peabody's help to fix everything despite Peabody's earlier warnings to never return to a time when they existed. As Sherman and Penny try to explain the situation Sherman's earlier self shows up. When Grunion arrives Peabody tries to conceal from the Petersons the presence of two Shermans; but the second Peabody arrives back from Ancient Troy complicating the situation. Troy Peabody reveals he survived the crash much to Sherman's relief. Grunion attempts to collect both Shermans but they and the Peabodys merge back together causing a massive cosmic shockwave. Grunion grabs Sherman to take him away for good to which an enraged Peabody reverts to his natural dog instincts and furiously bites Grunion in retaliation who then calls the New York Police Department. Peabody Penny and Sherman race to the WABAC but cannot time-travel due to a rip in the space-time continuum caused by the merger of their cosmic doubles.

However a desperate Sam attempts to leap onto the helicopter and is infected and falls which forces Flynn to abandon the four. Flynn contacts Doyle by radio and tells him to leave the civilians and head to Wembley Stadium. Doyle ignores his instructions and escorts Andy Tammy and Scarlet to Wembley. They break into an abandoned Volvo V70 to escape nerve gas released to kill the infected but are unable to start the car while soldiers with flamethrowers draw near. Doyle exits the car and sacrifices himself by push starting the car and is burned alive. Scarlet escapes an Apache gunship and drives Tammy and Andy into the London Underground where the trio continues on foot. Don ambushes and kills Scarlet then bites Andy.Tammy shoots Don before he can kill Andy who remains symptom-free but an unknown carrier of the Rage virus. They continue to the stadium and are picked up by a reluctant Flynn who flies them across the English Channel to France as instructed by Doyle. Twenty-eight days later a French-accented voice requesting help is heard from the radio in Flynn's abandoned helicopter. A group of the infected are then seen running through a tunnel that as they emerge into the open is revealed to be the exit of the Paris Métro Trocadéro Station with a view across the Seine to the nearby Eiffel Tower indicating that the virus has spread to Continental Europe.
2123,The Martian,In 2035 the crew of the Ares III mission to Mars is exploring Acidalia Planitia on Martian solar day (sol) 18 of their 31-sol expedition. A strong dust storm threatens to topple their Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) forcing them to abort the mission. During the evacuation astronaut Mark Watney is struck by debris and lost in the storm and telemetry from his suit's biomonitor stops. With Watney believed dead the storm worsening by the second and the MAV on the verge of toppling mission commander Melissa Lewis orders the crew to take off and return to their orbiting vessel the Hermes.Watney awakens after the storm to a low-oxygen warning and returns to the crew's surface habitat (Hab). Doing self-surgery he removes from his abdomen the debris that destroyed his biomonitor. He begins a video diary. Lacking communications with Earth his only chance of rescue is via the next Mars mission four years later: the Ares IV will be landing 3200 km away at the Schiaparelli crater. Watney's immediate concern is food; being a botanist he improvises a farm inside the Hab utilizing Martian soil fertilized with the crew's human feces water produced by extracting hydrogen from leftover rocket fuel and potatoes intended for the Thanksgiving dinner. He also begins to modify the only functional rover for longer journeys in preparation for the long-distance travel.After NASA holds a funeral for Watney satellite planner Mindy Park reviews images of the Hab area and realizes he has survived. NASA administrator Teddy Sanders has the news released but despite the objections of the Hermes flight director Mitch Henderson decides not to distract the Ares III crew (still en route back to Earth) by informing them.Watney takes the rover to retrieve the nearby Pathfinder probe which fell silent in 1997. Using Pathfinder 's camera and  motor he establishes rudimentary two-way communication with Earth first using simple signs and then sending and receiving ASCII in hexadecimal. NASA sends a software patch to link the rover with Pathfinder and communicate via text. Watney becomes angry when he learns that the crew has not been told of his survival and Sanders reluctantly lets Henderson finally inform them.Director of Mars missions Vincent Kapoor and Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) director Bruce Ng prepare an Iris space probe to deliver enough food to last Watney until Ares IV's arrival. Meanwhile the Hab's airlock malfunctions due to a small puncture destroying Watney's ability to grow further crops. Sanders orders the team to skip the usual safety inspections to launch the probe sooner but it fails 40 seconds after liftoff. Watney now feels his death is inevitable.The China National Space Administration has been developing a powerful classified booster rocket the Taiyang Shen. Feeling camaraderie with NASA's scientists they violate their government's secrecy and offer it to repeat the Iris mission. As Watney is still at more risk the longer he waits JPL astrodynamicist Rich Purnell devises an alternative plan: send the Taiyang Shen with supplies to the Hermes which will use Earth's gravity to slingshot back to Mars two years earlier than Ares IV. Sanders rejects the idea refusing to risk the crew on Hermes but Henderson surreptitiously sends them Purnell's plan. Risking their lives and careers they vote unanimously for it and make the necessary course change. Powerless to stop them NASA concedes the issue.Watney begins the 90-sol journey to Schiaparelli where the MAV for Ares IV has been pre-positioned but it needs to be lightened to make the rendezvous with Hermes on its new course. Watney must remove many components and replace the nose cone with a piece of the Hab's canvas. The MAV still fails to reach the required speed so Commander Lewis maneuvers Hermes consuming most of its available fuel then ordering a directional explosive decompression of the internal atmosphere. Finally she uses a Manned Maneuvering Unit but still cannot quite reach Watney. He pierces the glove of his pressure suit and uses the escaping air to propel himself towards Lewis effectively reuniting him with his crew after 560 sols alone on Mars.After returning to Earth Watney becomes a survival instructor for astronaut candidates. Five years later on the anniversary of the Ares V mission launch those involved in Watney's rescue have begun new lives.
2222,The Happening,In New York City's Central Park people begin committing mass suicide. Initially believed to be caused by a bio-terrorist attack using an airborne neurotoxin the behavior quickly spreads across the northeastern United States. High school science teacher Elliot Moore and his wife Alma are convinced by Elliot's mathematician colleague Julian to accompany him and his daughter Jess on a train out of Philadelphia. During the trip the group learns that Boston and Philadelphia have also been affected. The train loses all radio contact and stops at a small town. When Julian learns that his wife has left Boston for Princeton he decides to go look for her and entrusts Jess to the Moores. However Julian arrives to find Princeton has been affected and he commits suicide by slitting his wrist.Elliot Alma and Jess hitch a ride with a nurseryman and his wife. The nurseryman theorizes that plant life has developed a defense mechanism against humans consisting of an airborne toxin that stimulates neurotransmitters and causes humans to kill themselves. The group is later joined by other survivors coming from various directions and the small crowd chooses to avoid roads and populated areas. When the larger part of the group is affected by the toxin Elliot suggests the nurseryman was right and that the plants are targeting only large groups of people. He splits their group into smaller pockets and they walk along. The trio ends up with a pair of teenage boys Josh and Jared who are later killed when Elliot unsuccessfully attempts to reason with the armed residents of a barricaded house.Elliot Alma and Jess wander the countryside and come upon the home of Mrs. Jones an eccentric and paranoid elder. Jones initially agrees to house the group for the night but is suspicious of them having bad intentions;  the next morning she decides to expel them. In a fury she leaves the house alone and is affected by the toxin. The shaken Elliot realizes that the plants are now targeting individuals. Left with no option when the woman strikes her head into several windows the trio chooses to die and embraces in the yard only to find themselves unaffected by the toxin. The outbreak has abated as quickly as it began.Three months later Elliot and Alma have adjusted to their new life with Jess as their adopted daughter. On television an expert comparing the event to a red tide warns that the epidemic may have only been a harbinger of an impending global disaster but his theory is met with disbelief with the interviewer reminding him that only the northeastern United States was affected. Alma learns she is pregnant and surprises Elliot with the news at their front step.Another wave of suicides is initiated in the Luxembourg Gardens in Paris France.
2225,Victor Frankenstein,In  1890's London ambitious medical student Victor Frankenstein attends a circus performance where he helps save an injured aerialist Lorelei with the aid of a nameless hunchback enslaved by the circus' ringleader who harbors feelings for the girl. Impressed by the hunchback's vast knowledge of human anatomy acquired from stolen books Victor rescues him drains the cyst on his back that causes his physical abnormality and gives him a harness to improve his posture – he then names him Igor Straussman after his roommate who is not often at home. The two then become partners in Victor's ongoing experiments to resurrect life through artificial means incurring the wrath of devoutly religious police inspector Roderick Turpin who views their experiments as blasphemy.When Victor shows Igor his use of electricity to animate eyes Igor suggests he made mistakes attaching the nerves leading Victor to ask Igor to perform the surgical parts of his experiment. Victor procures parts from dead animals and makes Igor restore the organs which Victor secretly uses to create a monstrous chimpanzee-like creature nicknamed Gordon.Igor reunites with Lorelei now masquerading as the mistress of a closeted gay baron upsetting Victor who views Lorelei as a distraction. Igor invites Lorelei to a demonstration of their experiment which goes awry when Gordon escapes and wreaks havoc through the university before being killed by Victor and Igor. Lorelei is horrified by Victor's experiments and urges Igor to stop him from pursuing the matter further but Igor is reluctant to do so upon learning that Victor is driven by the need to atone for his indirect role in the death of his older brother Henry for which Victor's domineering father blames Victor.Victor is expelled from college for his unorthodox methods but attracts the attention of his wealthy arrogant classmate Finnegan who wants him to create an artificial humanoid creature. Victor and Igor outline a behemoth named Prometheus but Igor's deepening relationship with Lorelei soon causes a rift between them.Turpin and his men raid Victor's laboratory hell-bent on destroying his inventions. During the raid Igor stumbles onto the corpse of the real Igor Straussman dead from an overdose and the source of the eyes Victor had used in his experiments.  When he attacks Victor Turpin loses a hand and is blinded in one eye. Victor and Igor escape in a carriage sent by Finnegan and are taken to his family's estate.  Turpin is fired from Scotland Yard for having invaded Victor's home without a warrant.Finnegan provides the scientists with the necessary funds to build Prometheus and offers them laboratory facilities at his family's estate in Scotland. Igor is suspicious of Finnegan and outraged with Victor for his treatment of the original Igor.  After a falling out Victor departs for Scotland alone. Finnegan kidnaps and binds Igor revealing his plans to kill Victor once Prometheus is complete and weaponize his creation. Igor is then thrown into the River Thames to drown but manages to escape and reunites with Lorelei who nurses him back to health.Igor and Lorelei embark to Finnegan's estate in order to rescue Victor. Igor finds Victor on the verge of using lightning to animate Prometheus. Victor ignores Igor's pleas and activates the machine. A power surge overloads the machinery killing Finnegan and several of his employees. During the ensuing chaos Turpin unexpectedly arrives blaming and threatening Victor for his creation. Prometheus suddenly awakens and steps forward. Victor is initially ecstatic that the experiment has worked sharing a brief moment with Prometheus thinking him to be his resurrected brother Henry. Victor quickly realizes that the experiment has failed: Prometheus has no consciousness and can not talk. The shocked Turpin opens fire on Prometheus who goes into a rage killing Turpin and nearly killing Victor. Return to his senses Victor joins forces with Igor to kill Prometheus by stabbing its two hearts.After regaining consciousness the next morning Igor reunites with Lorelei who hands him a letter written to him by Victor in which Victor apologizes for all the suffering he caused says he is allowed to live his life with Lorelei informs him to be ready for when Victor may one day ask for his help and Victor recognizes Igor was his greatest creation. Victor retreats to the Scottish countryside in search of new discoveries.
2354,Planet of the Apes,In 2029 aboard the United States Air Force space station Oberon Leo Davidson works closely with primates who are trained for space missions. His favorite simian co-worker is a chimpanzee named Pericles. With a deadly electromagnetic storm approaching the station a small space pod piloted by Pericles is used to probe the storm. Pericles's pod heads into the storm and disappears. Leo takes a second pod and pursues Pericles. Entering the storm Leo loses contact with the Oberon and in 5021 A.D. crashes on a planet called Ashlar. He learns that the world is ruled by humanoid apes who speak English use domesticated horses for transportation and treat human beings as slaves.Leo meets a female chimpanzee named Ari who protests the mistreatment humans receive. Ari decides to buy Leo and a female slave named Daena to have them work as servants in the house of her father Senator Sandar. Leo escapes his cage and frees other humans. Limbo an orangutan trader in captured humans sees them but is taken prisoner to ensure his silence. The murderous General Thade and his junior Colonel Attar march ape warriors to pursue the humans. Leo discovers Calima the forbidden but holy temple of Semos the first ape whom the apes revere as a god.Calima turns out to be the remains of the Oberon which had crashed on the planet's surface and now looks ancient (the name Calima coming from the sign CAution LIve aniMAls the relevant letters being the only ones not covered in dust). According to the computer logs the station has been there for thousands of years. Leo deduces that when he entered the vortex he was pushed forward in time while the Oberon searching after him was not crashing on the planet long before he did.The Oberon's log reveals that the apes on board led by Semos organized a mutiny and  took over the vessel after it crashed. The human and ape survivors of the struggle left the ship and their descendants are the people Leo has encountered since landing. The apes arrive and attack the humans who have gathered to see Leo although he is able to even the odds when he uses the Oberon 's last fragments of fuel to fire a final blast at the first wave of apes. The battle stops when a familiar vehicle descends from the sky which Leo immediately identifies as the pod piloted by Pericles the chimp astronaut who was pushed forward in time as Leo was and had just now found his way to the planet the electromagnetic storm actually releasing people from it in an opposite direction in time to their entrance. When Pericles lands and the pod opens the apes bow interpreting his arrival as the return of Semos and hostilities between humans and apes suddenly cease.Pericles runs into the wreck of the Oberon and Leo runs after him followed by General Thade. Thade and Leo fight. Pericles tries to help Leo but Thade throws him hard against a wall. Thade takes Leo's gun from him and tries to fire it at Leo. Leo sees that Thade is within the pilot's deck and closes the automatic door trapping Thade inside. Thade fires the gun repeatedly at the door but the ricochets create sparks that scare Thade who huddles under a control panel. Deciding to escape Ashlar and return to Earth Leo gives Pericles to Ari who promises to look after him. After saying farewell to Ari and Daena Leo climbs aboard Pericles's undamaged pod and travels back in time through the same electromagnetic storm and crashes in Washington D.C. on Earth. He looks up at what appears to be the Lincoln Memorial only to find that it is now a monument memorializing General Thade. A swarm of police officers firefighters and news reporters all of whom are apes descend upon him.
2737,Morgan,Lee Weathers is a risk-management specialist for genetic-engineering company SynSect. She arrives at a rural site hosting its L-9 project an artificial being with nanotechnology-infused synthetic DNA named Morgan. The hybrid biological organism with the capacity for autonomous decision making and sophisticated emotional responses is smarter than humans and matures quickly walking and talking within a month and physically a teenager despite being five years old.The cold and precise Weathers who insists on calling Morgan it is at the site to assess the project while a psychologist evaluates Morgan who has used a pen to stab Dr. Kathy Grieff in the eye. Over dinner with the team of eight scientists Weathers and project leaders Dr. Lui Cheng and Dr. Simon Ziegler discuss an incident in Helsinki involving Cheng in which 21 SynSect researchers were killed in an hour by crude prototypes.Lee learns that Morgan attacked Grieff when she was prohibited from leaving her room a glass cell after killing a deer impaled on a fallen tree while outside. The scientists have reared Morgan from birth following two failed attempts and most consider her to be their child; Grieff defends Morgan to Weathers despite her injury and Dr. Amy Menser wants to resume taking her on outings. Menser promises to take Morgan to a nearby lake that she describes as wonderful; the behavioral therapist understands that Morgan is despite her intellect and physical appearance and abilities emotionally childlike. Although Morgan considers Cheng to be her mother the scientist is pessimistic about the project; she admits to Weathers that she ended the outings as it is cruel to expose Morgan to a world she cannot be allowed to enter.Psychologist and artificial intelligence expert Dr. Alan Shapiro arrives to assess Morgan and quickly defies the scientists' requests to stay outside Morgan's room for the assessment. When Shapiro aggressively taunts Morgan as part of his evaluation she becomes angry and spontaneously kills him. Weathers tranquilizes Morgan after a brief escape and decides that she is too unpredictable and must be terminated. The scientists refuse to kill Morgan; before Weathers can do so they shoot her with a tranquilizer dart and imprison her in the cell in which Morgan was held. The scientists plan to escape with Morgan but after waking Morgan believing they have betrayed her kills most of them while Ziegler commits suicide.In the scientists' house Cheng records an apology for the failure of the project. The scientists tried to make Morgan more human than the previous attempts so she could exceed her design as a combat weapon but found that the result was harder to control. Morgan arrives and after conversing with her mother in Chinese manually suffocates her. Weathers escapes the cell and briefly fights Morgan able to match her. Morgan flees with the terrified Menser who Morgan says is the only scientist who was a real friend to her.Weathers and nutritionist Skip Vronsky follow the pair. Vronsky deduces that Morgan has forced Menser to take her to the lake which entrances Morgan. She and Weathers fight again seemingly matched in strength and speed. Morgan knocks down Weathers who is impaled on the branch of a fallen tree. Morgan flees again and meets with Menser at the pier but Weathers having survived the impaling appears and forcibly drowns her into the water. She then shoots Menser and Vronsky apologizing first before leaving the scene.Weathers's superior at SynSect and another executive discuss the incident. They decide that it proves that the company's earlier L-4 project is superior. When the executive asks about Weathers the superior says she is perfect revealing that Weathers is actually the L-4 prototype lacking much of the emotional development Morgan had.Waiting in another room Weathers makes the same gesture with her hands as Morgan did.

3170,Captain America: The Winter Soldier,Two years after the Battle of New York Steve Rogers works in Washington D.C. for the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D. while adjusting to contemporary society. During a mission alongside Agent Natasha Romanoff and S.H.I.E.L.D.'s counter-terrorism S.T.R.I.K.E. team led by Agent Brock Rumlow to free hostages aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. vessel from pirates led by Georges Batroc Rogers discovers Romanoff has another agenda: to extract data from the ship's computers. Returning to the Triskelion S.H.I.E.L.D.'s headquarters Rogers confronts Director Nick Fury and is briefed about Project Insight: three Helicarriers linked to spy satellites designed to preemptively eliminate threats. Unable to decrypt Romanoff's data Fury becomes suspicious about Insight and asks senior S.H.I.E.L.D. official and Secretary of Internal Security Alexander Pierce to delay the project.On his way to rendezvous with Maria Hill Fury is ambushed by assailants led by an assassin called the Winter Soldier. Escaping to Rogers' apartment Fury warns him that S.H.I.E.L.D. is compromised but is wounded by the Winter Soldier before handing Rogers a flash drive containing the ship's data. Fury is pronounced dead during surgery and Hill recovers the body. The next day Pierce summons Rogers to the Triskelion. When Rogers withholds Fury's information Pierce brands him a fugitive. Hunted by S.T.R.I.K.E. Rogers meets with Romanoff. Using the data they discover a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. bunker in New Jersey where they activate a supercomputer containing the preserved consciousness of Arnim Zola. Zola informs them that after being captured by Rogers during World War II he was recruited to S.H.I.E.L.D. where he created a new more altruistic Hydra that has operated within its ranks sowing global chaos with the objective of making humanity surrender its freedom in exchange for security using the Winter Soldier as their primary assassin. The pair narrowly escape death when a S.H.I.E.L.D. missile destroys the bunker and realize that Pierce is Hydra's leader within S.H.I.E.L.D.Rogers and Romanoff enlist the help of VA employee and former USAF pararescueman Sam Wilson whom Rogers befriended and acquire his powered Falcon wingpack. They capture S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Jasper Sitwell a Hydra mole forcing him to divulge that Zola developed a data-mining algorithm that can identify individuals becoming threats to Hydra. The Insight Helicarriers will sweep the globe using satellite-guided guns to eliminate them. Sitwell is killed in an ambush by the Winter Soldier whom Rogers recognizes as Bucky Barnes his longtime best friend previously thought dead; he had survived his previous fall due to Zola's experimentation and has been repeatedly brainwashed and cryogenically frozen to perform Hydra's missions. Hill manages to extract the trio to a safehouse where Fury who had faked his death plans to sabotage the Helicarriers by replacing their controller chips.After the World Security Council members arrive for the Helicarriers' launch Rogers broadcasts Hydra's plot to everyone at the Triskelion. Romanoff disguised as one of the Council members disarms Pierce. Fury arrives and forces Pierce to unlock S.H.I.E.L.D.'s database so that Romanoff can leak classified information exposing Hydra to the public. Following a struggle Fury kills Pierce. Rogers and Wilson storm two Helicarriers and replace the controller chips but Barnes destroys Wilson's suit and fights Rogers on the third. Rogers fends him off and replaces the final chip allowing Hill to take control and have the vessels destroy each other. Rogers refuses to fight Barnes in an attempt to reach his friend but as the ship collides with the Triskelion Rogers falls into the Potomac River. Barnes rescues the unconscious Rogers before disappearing into the woods. With S.H.I.E.L.D. in disarray Romanoff appears before a Senate subcommittee while Fury under the cover of his apparent death heads to Eastern Europe in pursuit of Hydra's remaining cells. Rogers and Wilson decide to find the Winter Soldier while Rumlow who was a Hydra agent is hospitalized following the Triskelion's destruction.In a mid-credits scene Baron Wolfgang von Strucker at a Hydra lab proclaims that the age of miracles has begun as scientists examine an energy-filled scepter and two test subjects: one with superhuman speed the other with telekinetic powers. In a post-credits scene Barnes visits his own memorial at the Smithsonian Institution.
3172,Surrogates,In the near future widespread use of remotely controlled androids called surrogates enables everyone to live in idealized forms from the safety of their homes. Compared to their surrogates the human operators are depicted as slovenly and homebound. Protected from harm a surrogate's operator feels no pain when the surrogate is damaged and can do acrobatics that a normal person wouldn't. In Boston FBI agent Tom Greer has been estranged from his wife Maggie since their son's death in a car crash several years before. He never sees her outside of her surrogate and she criticizes his desire to interact via their real bodies.Tom and his partner Agent Jennifer Peters investigate the death of two people who were killed when their surrogates were destroyed at a Fort Point club. Jared Canter one of the victims is the son of Dr. Lionel Canter the inventor of surrogates and the former head of their manufacturing company Virtual Self Industries (VSI). The two determine that a human Miles Strickland used a new type of weapon to overload the surrogates' systems and kill their operators. After locating Strickland Tom attempts to bring him into custody. Strickland uses the weapon and injures Tom during the chase; Tom inadvertently crash-lands into an anti-surrogate zone known as the Dread Reservation (one of many throughout the US). A mob helps Strickland and destroys Tom's surrogate. The Dread leader a man known as the Prophet kills Strickland and confiscates the weapon.With his surrogate destroyed Tom is forced to interact in the world without one. He learns that VSI originally produced the weapon designed to load a virus that overloads a surrogate's systems thus disabling it under a government contract. Unexpectedly the weapon also disabled the fail-safe protocols protecting operators. The project was promptly scrapped and all prototypes supposedly destroyed. Tom also learns that Andrew Stone his FBI superior supplied the weapon to Strickland and ordered Dr. Canter's assassination upon VSI's request for his criticism of surrogate use. Jared using one of his father's many surrogates was killed instead. Jennifer is murdered in her own home by an unknown man who hijacks her surrogate and the Prophet orders the weapon delivered to her. During a military raid on the reservation the Prophet is shot revealing he was actually a surrogate with Canter himself as the operator. Tom steals the weapon's codes from Stone but Jennifer escapes with the codes.Immediately travelling to Canter's home Tom discovers that Canter has been controlling not only the Prophet but also Jennifer and the surrogate he used to kill Jennifer as well. Using Jennifer's surrogate in FBI Headquarters Canter uses the weapon to kill Stone and proceeds to upload the virus to all surrogates which will destroy them and kill their operators. Canter reveals that he only wanted to empower the disabled to live normal lives but after he was fired from VSI they capitalized on surrogacy for profit. Convinced his plan is unstoppable Canter disconnects from Jennifer's surrogate and swallows a cyanide pill. Tom takes control of Jennifer's surrogate and with the assistance of the network's system administrator Bobby Saunders insulates the virus so the operators will survive but a second step is required to save the surrogates. After a moment of consideration Tom chooses to let the virus permanently disable surrogates worldwide. With all the surrogates disabled people emerge from their homes confused and afraid.Returning home Tom shares an emotional embrace with Maggie in her real form. The film ends with an aerial view of the collapsed surrogates along with overlapping news reports of downed surrogates all over the world and how people are now on their own again.
3181,Captain America: The First Avenger,Steve Rogers a rejected military soldier transforms into Captain America after taking a dose of a Super-Soldier serum. But being Captain America comes at a price as he attempts to take down a war monger and a terrorist organization.
3192,Atlantis: The Lost Empire,A mysterious explosion sends a tsunami towards the city of Atlantis. During the evacuation the Queen of Atlantis is lifted up into a strange floating crystal leaving behind her distraught daughter Kida. The crystal merges with the Queen and creates a dome preserving the city's innermost district and Atlantis sinks beneath the waves.Nearly 8000 years later in 1914 Milo Thatch — a marginalized linguist at the Smithsonian Institution – discovers the existence of The Shepherd's Journal a manuscript containing directions to Atlantis. After Milo's proposal to search for the Journal is rejected by the museum board a mysterious woman Helga Sinclair introduces Milo to Preston B. Whitmore an eccentric millionaire. Whitmore has already funded a successful effort to retrieve the Journal as repayment of a debt to Milo's late grandfather and recruits Milo to decipher the journal and join an expedition to Atlantis.The expedition is headed by Commander Rourke who also led the Journal recovery expedition. The crew includes Helga; Vinny a demolitions expert; Molière a geologist; Dr. Sweet a medical officer; Audrey a mechanic; Mrs. Packard a radio operator; Cookie a chuckwagon chef; and several trained soldiers. They set out in the massive submarine Ulysses but are attacked by a mechanical leviathan that guards Atlantis' entrance. The Ulysses is destroyed leaving only a handful of survivors. Following the Journal's instructions they enter a cavern and travel through a dormant volcano where they are met by Kida miraculously still alive and young. She and the other Atlanteans have forgotten their written language and the society has languished but they can understand English due to spoken Atlantean being the basis for many modern languages.Against her father's wishes Kida enlists Milo to help Atlantis regain its old glory and leads him to an underwater mural in the sunken part of the city. Milo learns from the mural that The Heart of Atlantis provides the people there with longevity and once powered their devices via smaller crystals they all wear. He discovers a page of the Journal which also contained this information is missing. Returning to the surface he is confronted by Rourke who reveals he has the missing page revealing he is planning to steal the Heart and sell it at a high price callously not caring that about the Atlanteans’ fate. He and the crew capture Milo and Kida and Rourke mortally wounds the King of Atlantis demanding to know where the Heart is. However he eventually finds it for himself beneath the palace. The giant crystal sensing a threat merges with Kida and Rourke puts her in a crate intending to sell her at the surface. Milo sarcastically congratulates his friends which causes them to reconsider knowing that they don't want to be responsible for the death of innocent people. Rourke Helga and the soldiers leave the rest behind and start for the surface putting Atlantis and the citizens in danger. The dying King gives Milo his own crystal and explains he once attempted to create weapons from the Heart causing the past explosion and the fate of his wife. He also explains the crystal must have a royal host when the city is in danger and begs Milo to save Atlantis and Kida.Milo and his friends rally the Atlanteans to reactivate their machinery and pursue and attack the mercenaries. Rourke and Helga have a falling-out during the battle and he throws her into the dormant volcano. As she dies she shoots the airship containing Kida's crate. Milo and Rourke fight on the burning airship over the Heart and Milo slashes Rourke with a crystal-charged shard of glass turning Rourke into a living crystal statue which is shattered by the airship's propellers. The burning airship crash-lands and awakens the volcano. Milo and the rest flee back to Atlantis with Kida who still merged with the crystal rises into the sky and awakens ancient Stone Guardians who raise the flooded portion of Atlantis into the dome and protect the entire city from the lava flow. The Crystal then returns Kida alive to Milo.Milo elects to stay in Atlantis with Kida with whom he has fallen in love and the rest return to the surface promising to keep their adventures secret to preserve Atlantis's safety. Whitmore alone learns the truth from photographs taken by Mrs. Packard.
3202,G-Force,The film revolves around a special team of trained animals. The primary field team consists of three guinea pigs: Darwin Blaster and Juarez as well as a mole Speckles. The unit's leader Ben orders an unauthorized infiltration of the residence of home electronics and appliances magnate Leonard Saber. Saber's appliances all have control chips inside them that will activate a function called Sabersense allowing electronic communication. The team retrieves sensitive information about a scheme called Clusterstorm which will occur in 48 hours.However when Ben's superior Kip Killian arrives for his evaluation he is angry at Ben for performing an unauthorised mission. The government agent orders the unit shut down. With the help of the humans Darwin Juarez Blaster Mooch and Speckles escape but find themselves in a case bound for a pet shop. Ben and his assistant Marcie send a trained cockroach named Harry to infiltrate their hideout which is now guarded by FBI agents and recover Darwin's Personal Digital Assistant which contained the information acquired from Saber's computer.Trapped in the store's pet rodent display case G-Force meet Hurley a guinea pig Bucky a hamster and three mice. Although Blaster and Juarez manage to get themselves sold to a family with plans to return to extract their comrades Speckles is thrown and seemingly crushed in a garbage truck. Meanwhile Mooch manages to return to Ben to tell him where his mammalian agents are but Darwin escapes with Hurley before he can arrive to collect them.While Blaster and Juarez escape their new owners to return to Ben he and Marcie discover that the intel in the PDA has a computer virus that hid the scheme. At this time Darwin and Hurley make their own way to their superior. En route Darwin sees a Saberling coffee maker and decides to investigate it but it turns into a fighting robot; he and Hurley defeat it. Examining the wreckage they discover that Sabersense and Clusterstorm are both the same scheme and that the chips found inside the appliances actually transformed them into killer robots.Ben eventually confesses that they are not special genetically enhanced animals as previously told but ordinary ones Ben took in and trained for the team. However Hurley lifts them from their despair by reminding the team of the astounding feats that he has seen them do. He also suggests using the virus in the PDA to take down Saber's computer mainframe.Emboldened Ben provides the field team with the means to infiltrate the Saber residence and plant the virus in the mainframe. Unfortunately FBI agents are ordered by Killian to capture the animals dead or alive.After the team infiltrates Saber's mainframe they encounter a bomb trap but avoid it because of their size. In an appliance store all of the machines also transform into killing machines; one tries to kill the 3 guinea pigs. The team fight the monster until it is destroyed by the bomb trap and the resulting battle separates the group leaving only Darwin and Mooch to take the mainframe down.Darwin finds Speckles at the mainframe who reveals he is the mastermind tricking Saber into planting the control chips to repurpose Clusterstorm into causing a massive planet-wide bombardment of space debris to make Earth uninhabitable and reveals that he was the one who sabotaged G-Force's presentation to ensure that they did not find out about his plot. He explains his motive is to exact revenge on the human race for the death of his family.Speckles promptly amalgamates the various appliances in the vicinity into a giant walking robot which grabs the command truck with Marcie Killian Saber and Ben and Marcie inside. During the fight Darwin manages to persuade Speckles by saying that G-Force is his family now one he was close to destroying like what had happened to his first family long ago because Ben was the only human who took him in when they had nobody else. Realizing Darwin is right Speckles tries to shut down the robot but he cannot control them anymore. Darwin used the virus on his PDA to take it down destroying the robot and nearly killing Hurley while the FBI take Saber into custody.The guinea pigs are personally commended by the FBI Director who also appoints them special agents of the FBI.

After ten years an archeological dig on the Orkney Islands makes a key find.Back in the present Burroughs reads that Carter has now returned to Barsoom but his body on Earth is under threat from Therns and Burroughs is to be its protector for if it's harmed then his Barsoom projection will die. Carter warns Therns may even be attempting this before his nephew has finished reading the journal.Burroughs runs back to Carter's tomb and unlocks the door having been told he's the key and remembering his uncle called him Ned. As he opens the door and finds it empty a bowler-hatted Thern who was observing Carter before his death and is now following Ned steps forward from the dark to attack. Carter appears and kills the Thern taking his medallion. Ned realises Carter never found his own medallion and instead faked his own death to lure a Thern into a deadly trap. Carter confirms this and Ned agrees to be his protector on Earth. Carter re-enters the tomb whispers the code and is projected back to Barsoom.
804,Honey I Blew Up the Kid,Three years after inventor Wayne Szalinski accidentally shrunk his and his next door neighbor's kids his family have moved to Nevada and have welcomed a new son mischievous two-year old Adam. One day Wayne's wife Diane leaves with their daughter Amy to help her settle in her dorm at college leaving Wayne to look after Adam and their now teenage son Nick. He has developed a crush on Mandy Park who Wayne later arranges to babysit Adam. The next day Wayne takes Nick and Adam to Sterling Labs where he has constructed an advanced derivative of his shrink ray which could enlarge objects. He tests it out on Adam's favorite toy Big Bunny. However when his and Nick's backs are turned Adam attempts to retrieve it and is zapped by the machine which appears to short circuit and not enlarge the targeted object.Back home Adam and Big Bunny are exposed to electrical waves from the microwave oven and grow in size now 7 feet tall. Wayne and Nick try to take him back to the lab to reverse the process but are caught and kicked out by Wayne's coworker Dr. Charles Hendrickson who wants to take over Wayne's invention for himself. Diane returns home early and discovers what happened and she Wayne and Nick have a hard time trying to take care of the large Adam. Later Wayne and Diane drive to a warehouse and retrieve Wayne's first prototype to turn Adam back to normal with Wayne unintentionally test firing his original prototype on a pair of Nevada Highway Patrol motorcycle troopers pursuing his van for speeding to make sure it still worked before Diane orders him to return them to normal leaving the troopers completely spooked by the experience. When Mandy arrives to babysit Adam she panics and faints forcing Nick to subdue her so she cannot run away or scream. As he explains the situation to her Adam is exposed to the television's electrical waves and grows to 14 feet before escaping through a wall.Nick and Mandy search for him but are taken into custody with Adam placed into a truck. Wayne and Diane return home finding Dr. Hendrickson and a U.S. Marshal waiting for them. He has summoned Clifford Sterling the company chairman with the plan to fire Wayne have him and Diane arrested and experiment on Adam. Sterling arrives praises Wayne when he admits his mistake and pledges to help Adam while firing Dr. Hendrickson much to Wayne's and Diane's amazement. At the same time the truck carrying Adam passes by high voltage lines exposing him to more electrical waves and causing him to grow to 50 feet escaping confinement. He mistakes Nick and Mandy for toys and puts them in his overalls pocket before heading for Las Vegas pursued by his parents and the authorities. Wayne and Clifford figure out the cause of his growth and realize that exposure to Las Vegas' neon lights will make him grow bigger than ever.The infuriated Dr. Hendrickson refuses to accept his dismissal and turns to his ally board director Terrence Wheeler and they plan to start a boardroom coup to take Sterling out of power. With his permission Dr. Hendrickson forcefully boards a military helicopter to attempt to tranquilize Adam despite the pilot's reluctance. Wayne is determined to use his shrinking machine to shrink Adam back to normal but needs him to stand still for twelve seconds so he can be shrunk. At first he tries using Big Bunny to pacify him but it backfires when Wayne suggests for Adam to take a nap (which Adam hates). After growing to 112 feet and wandering through Las Vegas causing a panic among the crowd he pursues an ice cream truck driven by Marshall Preston Brooks to distract him away from the city while Sterling has the various hotels and casinos shut off their lights to avoid making Adam grow more. However Adam then heads towards the Hard Rock Café where he plays the lit up guitar. Diane realizes Adam will be still should she be enlarged as well. Dr. Hendrickson arrives in the helicopter and starts shooting tranquilizer cartridges at Adam hitting the guitar instead causing Adam to cry out in pain at the electric shock. As the panicked crowd begins to feel sorry for Adam and Dr. Hendrickson adamantly attempts to strike again a giant-sized Diane arrives and stops the helicopter. She then comforts Adam and manages to get him to stand still for the needed time period for the shrinking ray to work. Wayne then fires it returning them to normal size. Dr. Hendrickson arrives and attempts to justify his actions but a furious Diane knocks him out cold with a punch to the face.Wayne and Diane then realize that Nick and Mandy had somehow disappeared from Adam's overalls pocket. It is then revealed that the two teens along with a car that Adam retrieved during his rampage have been shrunk while in said pocket. They are quickly found by Wayne who decides to give them a few minutes of privacy before returning them to normal size. The only problem left now pointed out by a state trooper with the Szalinskis is how to shrink the gigantic Big Bunny.

4106,PK,An android alien lands on Earth naked on a research mission in Rajasthan but is stranded when the remote control for his spaceship is stolen. He manages to get the thief's cassette recorder. On the same day in Belgium an Indian woman Jagat Janani Sahni alias Jaggu meets a Pakistani Sarfaraz Yousuf and falls in love with him. Jaggu's father objects to their relationship citing difference in their religions. He consults godman Tapasvi Maharaj who predicts that Sarfaraz will betray Jaggu. Determined to prove them wrong Jaggu asks Sarfaraz to marry her. At the wedding she is heartbroken when she receives an unsigned letter believing it is from Sarfaraz calling off the wedding due to cultural differences.Jaggu returns to India and becomes a news reporter. She meets the alien and is intrigued to see him distribute leaflets about the missing God. She earns his trust by rescuing him when he attempts to take money from a temple's collection box as a refund on God's broken promises. The alien tells her that he is an 'astronaut' from another planet. His people know nothing about dressing religion or verbal communication; they transfer ideas by holding hands.A flashback shows how after being accidentally hit by a truck the alien is befriended by bandmaster Bhairon Singh who takes him along with his troop. Bhairon takes him to a brothel where the alien holds a prostitute Phuljhadiya's hand for six hours and thus learns the Bhojpuri language. The alien begins speaking and after learning of the whole scenario Bhairon tells him that his thief may be in Delhi. The alien leaves for Delhi. Due to his strange behaviour people assume he is drunk and call him peekay or PK (Hindi for drunk); the alien adopts PK as a name (his people have no language and thus no names). People tell PK that only God can help him find his remote. He sincerely practices Indian religions including Hinduism Sikhism Christianity and Islam attempting to find God to no avail. He later discovers that Tapasvi has his remote who claims it was a gift from God and refuses to return it. Jaggu promises PK that she will recover his remote and he can go back home.PK conjectures as Jaggu plays a prank on an unknown caller that Tapasvi and other godmen must be dialling a wrong number to communicate with God and are advising the public to engage in meaningless rituals. Jaggu encourages the public to expose fraudulent godmen by sending their videos to her news channel. This wrong number campaign turns into a popular mass movement to the dismay of Tapasvi. Meanwhile Bhairon finds the thief and contacts PK telling him that he sold his remote to Tapasvi. PK realises that Tapasvi was a fraud all along and that it was not a wrong number. Bhairon brings the thief to Delhi but both die in a terrorist attack.Tapasvi decides to confront PK on-air. Tapasvi asks PK what the right number is. PK says that God created us all is the only concept people should believe in and that the other duplicate Gods are artificial. Tapasvi argues saying that PK is trying to take people away from their Gods and that they will not stand for their Gods being taken away. He claims he has a direct connection to God and refers to his prediction of Sarfaraz's betrayal to try to prove that Muslims are liars. PK having absorbed Jaggu's memories earlier realises that Sarfaraz did not write the letter to Jaggu.Jaggu contacts the Pakistani Embassy in Belgium where Sarfaraz worked part-time. The embassy receptionist tells her that Sarfaraz has been annoying the embassy officials by repeatedly asking if they received a call from Delhi implying that he still loves Jaggu. That day Sarfaraz found the same letter and thought it was from Jaggu and did not call her as he understood she was under familial pressure. Jaggu and Sarfaraz reconnect and Tapasvi is forced by Jaggu's father to return PK's remote.Meanwhile PK has fallen in love with Jaggu but refrains from telling her because she loves Sarfaraz. Having filled multiple audio tapes with her voice alone he takes two suitcases full of tapes and extra batteries when leaving for home. He lies to Jaggu that the tapes contain a variety of Earthly noises which he will miss such as crows and car horns. Jaggu realises his love for her by seeing the note he wrote for her earlier but does not directly confront him about it. PK does not even look back while going as he doesn't want her to see him in tears which will give away his love for her. After his departure Jaggu publishes a book about him with Sarfaraz and her family assisting.One year later PK returns to Earth on a new research mission on human nature with more members of his species.

7021,Terminator Salvation,In 2003 Dr. Serena Kogan of Cyberdyne Systems convinces death row inmate Marcus Wright to sign over his body for medical research following his execution. Sometime later the automated Skynet system is activated and becomes self-aware; perceiving humans as a threat to its existence it starts a nuclear holocaust to eradicate them in the event known as Judgment Day.In 2018 John Connor orchestrates an attack on a Skynet base where he discovers prisoners and schematics in a laboratory for incorporating living tissue to a new type of Terminator which he recognizes as the T-800 model. John survives an explosion on the base which is destroyed. Following John's departure Marcus emerges from the base's wreckage and begins walking toward Los Angeles.John returns to the Resistance headquarters located aboard a nuclear submarine and is briefed by General Ashdown that the Resistance has discovered a hidden signal containing a code protocol that they believe can initiate a shutdown of Skynet's machines. The Resistance plans to launch an offensive against Skynet's headquarters in San Francisco. It is decided among the Resistance that the offensive will commence in four days due to an intercepted kill-list created by Skynet which plans to kill the Resistance's leaders within the same time frame. John learns he is second on this list following Kyle Reese. The Resistance leaders do not understand Kyle's importance but John knows that Kyle will eventually travel back in time and become his father and realizes that Skynet has learned of this fact.Arriving at the ruins of Los Angeles Marcus encounters Kyle and a mute child named Star during a skirmish with Skynet's machines. Kyle and Star are subsequently abducted and taken prisoner by Skynet. Two Resistance A-10 airplanes are shot down while trying to intercept a machine transport. Marcus locates downed pilot Blair Williams and they make their way to John's base where Marcus is wounded by a magnetic land mine. Attempting to save his life the Resistance fighters discover that Marcus is actually a cyborg with a cybernetic endoskeleton and a partially artificial cerebral cortex. Although Marcus insists that he is human John and his wife Kate suspect that Marcus has been sent to execute them and John orders him to be killed. Blair helps Marcus escape. During the pursuit Marcus saves John's life from Skynet's hydrobots and the two make a bargain: Marcus will enter Skynet's headquarters in San Francisco to help John rescue Kyle and the other prisoners if he lets him live.John pleads with General Ashdown to delay the offensive so he can formulate a plan to extract the human captives but Ashdown refuses and relieves John of his command. However the Resistance disobeys Ashdown's orders and instead awaits John's signal. Marcus enters the base interfaces with the computer and disables perimeter defenses so that John can release the prisoners. Marcus learns from Skynet (which assumes the form of Dr. Kogan on a screen) that he was resurrected by it in order to lure John to the base; when the Resistance launches its attack John will be killed achieving Skynet's goal. The hidden signal that the Resistance received earlier is revealed to be a ruse and Skynet uses it to track down and destroy the Resistance command submarine.Refusing to accept his fate Marcus tears out the hardware linking him to Skynet and leaves to aid John. John locates Kyle and Star but they are ambushed by a T-800 Terminator. As Kyle and Star escape Marcus appears and fights the T-800 while John rigs together nuclear fuel cells to destroy the facility. Marcus is soon outclassed in strength and temporarily disabled until John comes to his aid after which John is stabbed through the chest by the T-800 from behind. Marcus destroys the T-800 by tearing its head off and he John Kyle and Star are airlifted out. John detonates the explosives destroying a stockpile of Skynet's weapons including the T-800s with the base.At a field hospital John's injury is deemed terminal so Marcus offers his heart for transplantation sacrificing himself to save John. As he recovers John radios to other Resistance fighters that although this battle has been won the war continues.
7029,Stealth,Deeply ensconced in a top-secret military program three pilots struggle to bring an artificial intelligence program under control before it initiates the next world war.
7034,Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,Several years after destroying Cyberdyne Systems John Connor has been living as a nomad following the death of his mother Sarah to hide from the malevolent artificial intelligence Skynet despite a war between humans and machines not happening in 1997 as foretold. Unable to locate John in the past Skynet sends the T-X an advanced prototype shapeshifting Terminator made of virtually impervious liquid metal back in time to John's present in Los Angeles to instead kill his future allies in the human resistance. The human resistance sends back a reprogrammed T-800 Terminator a less-advanced metal endoskeleton covered in synthetic flesh to protect the T-X's targets including John and his future wife Kate Brewster.After killing other targets the T-X locates the pair at an animal hospital where Kate works. John becomes the T-X's primary target but the Terminator helps him and Kate escape taking them to a mausoleum where John's mother is supposedly interred. Inside her vault they find a weapons cache left at Sarah's request in case Judgment Day was not averted and the Terminators returned. They escape from an armed battle with the police and fend off the pursuing T-X. The Terminator reveals that John and Sarah's actions only delayed Judgment Day and that Skynet's attack will occur that day; the Terminator intends to drive John and Kate to Mexico to escape the fallout when Skynet begins its nuclear attack at 6:18 p.m. John orders the Terminator to take Kate and him to see her father U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Robert Brewster. Kate agrees at her identical request as she had reprogrammed the Terminator who killed John in the future in sending back in time for orders.Meanwhile General Brewster is supervising the development of Skynet for Cyber Research Systems (CRS) which also develops autonomous weapons. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff pressures him to activate Skynet to stop an anomalous computer virus from invading servers worldwide. General Brewster discovers too late that the virus was actually Skynet slowly becoming self-aware. John and Kate arrive too late to stop Skynet from being activated. The T-X fatally injures General Brewster and activates the CRS weaponized machines which kill the employees. Before he dies General Brewster gives Kate and John the location of what John believes is Skynet's system core. The pair head for the tarmac to take General Brewster's single-engine plane to Crystal Peak a facility built inside the Sierra Nevada. After a battle the T-X severely damages the Terminator reprogramming it to kill John and pursues John and Kate through the CRS facility. When a particle accelerator is activated it magnetically binds the T-X to the equipment. The still-consciously-aware Terminator struggles to control its outer functions. As it prepares to kill John he urges the Terminator to choose between its conflicting programming; it deliberately forces a shutdown of its corrupted system enabling the pair's escape. Shortly after they leave the Terminator's system reboots. Meanwhile the T-X escapes the accelerator and resumes pursuit.After John and Kate reach Crystal Peak the T-X arrives by helicopter. Before it can attack the Terminator arrives in a second helicopter and crashes into and crushes the T-X. The T-X pulls itself from the wreckage losing its legs and attempts to drag itself inside the bunker to follow the pair. The Terminator holds the bunker door open long enough for the pair to lock them inside then uses its last hydrogen fuel cell to destroy both itself and the T-X.John and Kate discover that Crystal Peak is not Skynet's core but rather a nuclear fallout shelter and command facility for government and military officials. Having no core Skynet has become a part of cyberspace after becoming self-aware. Judgment Day begins as Skynet fires nuclear missiles worldwide starting a nuclear holocaust that kills billions. The pair begin receiving radio transmissions on the emergency equipment; John tentatively assumes command by answering radio calls and they reluctantly accept their fate.
7041,Hollow Man II,At a cocktail party at the Reisner Institute a Washington think tank an invisible force drags a scientist named Devin into a nearby bathroom where the force (implied to be a person) brutally throws Devin around for information. Devin mentions another scientist Maggie Dalton who knows the formula the invisible person is looking for. Apparently accepting this the man releases him warning him not to divulge information about this incident to anybody. As soon as the invisible man leaves (or rather pretends to leave)  Devin attempts to call someone on his cell phone but the invisible man smashes the phone and slashes Devin's throat. The police arrive at the laboratory to conduct a murder investigation but the laboratory's military supervisor Colonel Gavin Bishop insists it is an internal military incident and the police have no jurisdiction. Fearing attacks on the remaining scientists the lab's owner Dr. William Reisner employs Frank Turner and his partner Detective Lisa Martinez to protect Maggie but refuses to divulge any information on the nature of his work.The two detectives stand guard outside Maggie's house. When Lisa opens the door to let the cat in the invisible man sneaks past her into the house. Just as he reaches the study where Maggie is Lisa tracks him down and he strangles her with a lamp's power cord. Suddenly armed military commandos appear and storm the house using thermal goggles to target and corner the invisible man. Outside Turner confronts Bishop realizing that they used him and Lisa to lure the invisible man to the house. Several stun grenades go off around the house incapacitating the soldiers and allowing the invisible man to escape in pursuit of Turner and Maggie. He almost catches up to them but is struck and badly injured by a car and flees.Maggie is taken into protective custody by the police where Turner's superior and friend Captain Tom Harrison has received orders to have her transferred to military custody. Frank helps Maggie escape from the police station and they flee in a stolen car. Bishop and Reisner knowing their careers would end if Maggie talks declare them fugitives.Maggie later tells Turner that five years prior a team of scientists figured out how to make humans invisible but something went wrong leaving only two survivors. A year after the original project was scrapped the Reisner Institute restarted the experiments as a covertly Department of Defense-funded operation to create the perfect soldier codenamed Silent Knight which attempts to render humans invisible. The resulting serum does turn human tissue invisible but with adverse effects: as it allows light to pass directly through the subject the radiation damages the cells and causes physical and mental degradation slowly killing the person. Maggie developed a compound called the Buffer to counteract the effects of that particular radiation. A soldier named Michael Griffin volunteered and the serum succeeded but the Buffer failed and Griffin seemingly died which in turn got Maggie fired. Maggie believes that Griffin faked his death so he could use his powers without restraint but now needs the antidote to the radiation before he dies.Maggie receives a message from a man named Ludlow who has been in contact with her for weeks. Turner uses his contacts to find Ludlow a soldier enlisted into the program after Sebastian Caine (the original guinea pig) but before Griffin. He had gone into hiding but is now slowly dying from radiation. Ludlow has also been tracking Griffin and reveals the true story to his supposed death and the program itself: Operation Silent Knight was never about national security and neither was Griffin given the Buffer since the Department used him to assassinate their political enemies.Meanwhile Griffin infiltrates Bishop's office and both get into a fight. The latter attempts to reason with him and then getting desperate stabs him but not kills him with a pen. Griffin impales Bishop with the same pen and uses his computer to locate Ludlow. Arriving at the hideout Griffin attacks Turner but Ludlow intervenes sacrificing himself to allow Turner and Maggie to escape. Griffin decides to make them return by capturing Maggie's sister. When they meet at the train station where he is hiding Griffin silently catches Maggie and tries to turn her invisible so he can take her unnoticed but Turner intervenes. After a short fight Griffin escapes with Maggie leaving Turner with the arriving Reisner and his guards. A short time later Reisner pursues an invisible man but is soon captured and held by him. Believing him to be Griffin he offers to send for the Buffer. The figure however is Turner who used Griffin's discarded syringe to become invisible as well. Reisner backing away is hit and killed by a speeding car.Griffin takes Maggie to her old college laboratory to create the Buffer for him. Griffin forces her to inject herself with it first then injects himself with another dose. With his survival seemingly assured Griffin tries to kill Maggie but Turner (now invisible) intervenes and knocks him out of the laboratory window. Turner runs outside where Griffin renders him unconscious. As Griffin slowly turns visible Maggie reveals that he has been poisoned as the vial contained rat poison; she loses consciousness. Enraged Griffin takes a shovel and attempts to kill her but Turner having recovered stops him and impales him with the shovel. He then carries Maggie away for medical attention leaving Griffin's body outside in the rain.A few days later Maggie is recovering in hospital and is poised to be released. Heather tells her that Turner has not been found. Maggie insists that he will come back to her as she knows that he needs her. Outside they are being watched by a hooded invisible man presumably Turner who then walks away.
7042,Priest,A centuries-long war between humans and vampires has devastated the planet's surface and led to a theocracy under an organization called The Church. Despite the vampires' vulnerability to sunlight and all of mankind's technological advances the vampires' greater strength and speed made them impossible to defeat until humanity sheltered in giant walled cities and trained a group of elite warriors the Priests which turned the tide.In the opening scene a group of Priests enters the Sola Mira Hive but are ambushed by the vampires.  As they attempt to retreat one of their number is seized from behind and their leader tries to pull him to safety but is forced to let go and watch him dragged screaming back into the hive.Years later the majority of the vampires have been killed while the remainder were placed in reservations. With the war over the Clergy disbanded the Priests. Outside the walled cities some humans seek out a living free from the totalitarian control of The Church.Priest (Paul Bettany) is approached by Hicks (Cam Gigandet) the sheriff of a free town Augustine. Priest learns that his brother Owen and Owen's wife Shannon—Priest's girlfriend before he was recruited by the clergy—were mortally wounded in a vampire attack and Priest's niece Lucy (Lily Collins) was kidnapped. Hicks asks for Priest's help in rescuing Lucy. Priest asks the Church to reinstate his authority but leader Monsignor Orelas (Christopher Plummer) does not believe the vampire story and refuses insisting on maintaining the common belief that the vampires have been completely defeated for fear of compromising the Church's authority. Priest defiantly leaves the city and Orelas sends three Priests and a Priestess (Maggie Q) to bring him back.Priest and Hicks arrive at Nightshade Reservation where humans called Familiars people infected with a pathogen that makes them subservient to the vampires live alongside a number of the surviving vampires. After a fierce battle the pair discovers that most of the vampires have taken shelter in Sola Mira which was thought to have been abandoned after the war. Priestess one of Priest's team during the failed attack on the Hive joins them at Sola Mira. The trio destroys a Hive Guardian vampire then discover that the vampires have bred a new army and dug a tunnel out of the mountain towards a town called Jericho. The other three Priests have arrived at Jericho just as night falls and an armored train arrives unleashing hundreds of vampires upon the population. The vampires are led by a powerful and mysterious human wearing a black hat (Karl Urban). When the three Priests reject Black Hat's offer to join him he kills them all.The next morning Priest Priestess and Hicks arrive in Jericho and discover the town empty and the three dead Priests crucified. Priest and Priestess share an intimate moment when she confesses her feelings for him hoping that now that Shannon has died he would no longer feel bound to her. Priest gently refuses. Priest realizes that the vampires have been using the trains to travel by day and attack the free towns by night with the walled cities at the end of the train line. Hicks believes the cities are likewise protected by the sun but Priest explains that the cities' massive clouds of smoke and ash have permanently deprived them of sunlight.  If the train reaches one of the cities the attack will be a slaughter.Hicks who is in love with Lucy threatens Priest believing that Priest intends to kill her if she has been infected by the vampires.  Priestess explains that he cannot do so because Lucy is actually Priest's daughter and that Owen stepped in as a husband and a father when Priest was taken by the Church.  Lucy was never told the truth about her parentage.While Priestess rushes ahead to plant a bomb on the railroad tracks Priest and Hicks board the train to rescue Lucy. Battling vampires and Familiars the two are finally overpowered by Black Hat just as they find Lucy. Black Hat is revealed as the priest who was lost in the attack on Sola Mira.  After being captured the vampire Queen gave him her blood turning him into the first Vampire-Human hybrid who can survive the sun. As Priest fights Black Hat Lucy discovers the truth about her parentage. On the tracks ahead of the train Priestess battles several Familiars but one of them destroys the detonator for the explosives.  Instead she mounts the explosives on her motor bike and drives it into the train engine. The explosion and subsequent derailment kills the vampires and engulfs Black Hat in flames while Hicks Priest Priestess and Lucy are able to escape.Priest returns to the city and confronts Monsignor Orelas during Mass telling him of the burnt train containing the vampires' bodies but not the Queen's. He proves this by throwing a vampire head onto the floor and shocking everyone in the room. Orelas still refuses to believe him declaring that the war is over while Priest says that it is just beginning. Outside the city Priest meets Priestess who confirms that other Priests have been notified and will meet them at a rendezvous point. Priest sets off into the sunset.
7046,The Last Days on Mars,In the 2040s a Martian research base Tantalus Base outpost is established. The eight person crew who have been stationed there for six months is only nineteen hours from the completion of their research mission. The spacecraft Aurora is inbound from Earth and will collect the team by lander. Mars scientist Marko Petrović has found samples that point to life on the planet. Without revealing his discovery he devises a ruse for a last EVA on the surface. Crewmate Richard Harrington drives Petrović in a solar-powered rover to the spot where he had found the sample. After he obtains soil with the biological agent present Petrović falls into a sinkhole that suddenly opens.Captain Charles Brunel and crewmate Lauren Dalby plan to explore the pit to retrieve Petrović's body. Dalby remains at the pit but disappears before the team can return with equipment. Brunel authorizes Vincent Campbell to explore the pit and he finds that a fungal organism is present in the fissure. Dalby and Petrović reappear at the main outpost but exposure to the organism has altered them into fast aggressive intelligent zombie-like creatures with blackened skin and no trace of their original personalities. Harrington dies from a power drill attack by one of the zombies and later revives as one himself. The remaining crew hold off the zombies while Brunel and Campbell return. Brunel is also fatally injured and reanimates which provides the crew with new insight into the symptoms: thirst memory loss and aggression.After several fights and escapes from the zombies through the habitat modules mission psychologist Robert Irwin traps scientist Kim Aldrich who had often infuriated her crewmates. Rebecca Lane is also stabbed in the leg during the frantic escape to a rover. With their rover's power low the survivors – Campbell Irwin and Lane – decide they must get to the other rover which is still at the site of the fissure. Under the pretence of a scouting operation Irwin steals the second rover and fails to persuade Campbell to abandon Lane who he states is infected. Irwin meanwhile conceals evidence of his possible infection.While Campbell and Lane wait for the sun to rise and the solar powered batteries to recharge they discuss the nature of the zombies and Lane questions whether any human consciousness remains trapped in them. Campbell attempts to comfort her and falls asleep. When he wakes up alone Campbell realizes that Lane has fled into the desert and he chases her. Lane who knows she is likely to turn fails to deter Campbell from following her and in desperation commits suicide by removing her helmet. After she dies Lane reanimates and begs Campbell to destroy her. Campbell reluctantly complies by bashing her head in with a rock.Campbell and Irwin separately converge on the Aurora lander where the reanimated Aldrich kills the lander's crew. Petrovic and the other zombies appear desiccated and inert. An infected Irwin initiates a launch which takes him and Campbell into orbit. Campbell stuns Irwin and ejects the body and virulent blood droplets into the vacuum of space. In a message to mission control Campbell says he does not have enough fuel for a rendezvous but supplies aboard can last for months if they want to launch a rescue. He tells them that this might not be advisable as he could be infected; if so he has just enough fuel for re-entry and a fast death. Campbell concludes that it will take 15 minutes for the transmission to be received and will await their reply. He subsequently ends the communication still floating alone in space.

Britt and Kato quickly become best friends and get drunk together. Upon agreeing that they both hated James the two visit the graveyard to decapitate James's memorial statue. After they succeed Britt sees a couple getting mugged. When he tries to stop them he gets beaten up and is about to be tortured. Luckily Kato spots him and saves Britt by using his martial arts training and his ability to sense danger through the pupil of his eye. When the police mistake Britt and Kato for criminals Kato evades them in a car chase as he and Britt return to their mansion. Britt convinces Kato they should become superhero-like crime-fighters posing as criminals. Kato develops an Imperial car (once owned by Britt's father) outfitted with several gadgets and weapons which they call the Black Beauty. Britt plans to capture Benjamin Chudnofsky a Russian mobster and gangster uniting the crime families of Los Angeles under his command and whom his father was trying to expose. To get Chudnofsky's attention Britt uses the Daily Sentinel as a vehicle to publish articles about a high-profile criminal he names The Green Bee but later renames it The Green Hornet from Kato's suggestion and his staff's agreement to the latter name.Britt hires Lenore Case as his researcher and uses her unwitting advice to raise the Green Hornet's profile. Britt and Kato blow up several of Chudnofsky's meth labs leaving calling cards so Chudnofsky can contact them. Throughout all this the Daily Sentinel's managing editor Mike Axford fears this single-minded coverage will endanger Britt's life and District Attorney Frank Scanlon frets over public perception that he cannot stop the Green Hornet. Britt asks Lenore out for dinner but she rebuffs him and instead invites Kato making Britt confused and jealous. Kato learns from her that mobsters often offer a peace summit to rivals in order to get close enough to kill them; Britt then tells Kato that Chudnofsky has offered them such a meeting. Kato tries dissuading him but Britt feeling overshadowed follows his instincts. This nearly proves fatal when Chudnofsky tries to kill them by burying them alive. Fortunately Kato manages to save them by blowing up the sand covering their car and they escape while also killing one of Chudnofsky's men Chilli. Chudnofsky and his men attempt to kill the duo but they barely escape. Upon returning to the mansion Britt and Kato start arguing and the two get into a brutal fight causing Britt to angrily fire both Kato and Lenore who he believes are in a relationship.Later Kato receives an email from Chudnofsky on the Hornet's calling-card email address offering $1 million and half of Los Angeles to the Hornet if he kills Britt. Meanwhile Britt discovers that Scanlon is corrupt and that he tried to bribe James into downplaying the city's crime level to help his career. Chudnofsky meanwhile suffers a midlife crisis and renames himself as a supervillain known as Bloodnofsky. Scanlon invites Britt to a meeting in a restaurant where he reveals to Britt in his eye that he was responsible for the murder of his father as he is shown to be an ally of Chudnofsky. Kato arrives to apparently kill Britt with Chudnofsky and some of his men outside waiting for the deed to be done. After Britt apologizes to Kato for his immature behavior Kato accepts and saves Britt from certain death. Suddenly Chudnofsky and his men storm the restaurant and attempts to murder the duo but they barely escape in another Black Beauty.Chudnofsky Scanlon and many of their men chase them throughout L.A. determined to kill the duo and retrieve the hard drive that Britt has that recorded their conversation that may have enough evidence to convict Scanlon and his associates. The chase goes on until they arrive at the Daily Sentinel. At the Daily Sentinel Britt intends to upload the recording of Scanlon's confession onto the Web - which he belatedly discovers he did not manage to record. Chudnofsky and his men who followed the duo there engage them in a firefight. Kato engages in a battle against Chudnofsky himself but he gets his leg pinned underneath some rubble allowing Chudnofsky to prepare to execute him. However Britt finally manages to use his own eye pupil ability that is similar to Kato's: identify the enemies and attack them all at once. He successfully pulls this off but he falls down distracting Chudnofsky and allowing Kato to impale Chudnofsky in the eyes with his nunchucks before Britt executes him with his own double-barreled pistol. A SWAT team appears and fires at the Green Hornet and Kato managing to hit Britt in the shoulder. They use the remains of their nearly demolished Black Beauty to run Scanlon out of the building to his death. The two escape by using the ejection seats built in the car suggested by Britt earlier.The Green Hornet and Kato flee to Lenore's house where she learns their true identities and hides them from the police before trying to help by removing the bullet from Britt. The next morning Britt promotes Axford to chief editor and lies about being shot by Kato further establishing the Green Hornet as a vigilante and allowing Britt to get treated by professionals in a hospital. Later Britt and Kato weld the head back onto James's statue. Now with Lenore on their side the two decide to continue protecting Los Angeles by taking on the rest of the criminal organizations in the city with Britt as the Green Hornet.

7471,Gattaca,In the not-too-distant future eugenics is common. A genetic registry database uses biometrics to classify those so created as valids while those conceived naturally and more susceptible to genetic disorders are known as in-valids. Genetic discrimination is illegal but in practice genotype profiling is used to identify valids to qualify for professional employment while in-valids are relegated to menial jobs.Vincent Freeman was conceived naturally and his genetic profile indicates a high probability of several disorders and an estimated lifespan of 30.2 years. His parents regretting their decision use genetic selection in conceiving their second child Anton Jr. Growing up the two brothers often play a game of chicken by swimming out to sea as far as possible with the first one returning to shore considered the loser and Vincent always loses. Vincent dreams of a career in space travel but is always reminded of his genetic inferiority. One day Vincent challenges Anton to a game of chicken and beats him. Anton starts to drown and is saved by Vincent. Shortly after Vincent leaves home.Years later Vincent works as an in-valid cleaning office spaces including that of spaceflight conglomerate Gattaca Aerospace Corporation. He gets a chance to pose as a valid by using donated hair skin blood and urine samples from former swimming star Jerome Eugene Morrow who was paralyzed after being hit by a car. With Jerome's genetic makeup Vincent gains employment at Gattaca and is assigned as navigator for an upcoming mission to Saturn's moon Titan. To conceal his identity Vincent must meticulously groom and scrub down daily to remove his own genetic material pass daily DNA scanning and urine tests using Jerome's samples and hide his heart defect.When a Gattaca administrator is murdered a week before a possible launch the police find one of Vincent's eyelashes near the crime scene but can only identify it as from an unregistered in-valid and thus launch an investigation to find who owns the eyelash. During this Vincent becomes close to a co-worker Irene Cassini and falls in love with her. Though a valid Irene has a higher risk of heart failure that will bar her from any deep space mission. Vincent also learns that Jerome's paralysis is self-inflicted; after placing silver in the Olympics Jerome threw himself in front of a car. Jerome maintains that he was designed to be the best yet somehow wasn't and is suffering because of this.Vincent repeatedly evades the grasp of the investigation. Finally it is revealed that Gattaca's mission director Josef killed the administrator because he threatened to cancel the mission. Vincent learns that the detective who closed the case was his brother Anton who consequently has discovered Vincent's presence. The brothers meet and Anton warns Vincent about his illegal actions but Vincent asserts that he has gotten to this position on his own merits. Anton challenges Vincent to a final game of chicken. As the two swim out at night Vincent's stamina surprises Anton so Vincent reveals that he won by not saving energy for the swim back. Anton turns back and begins to drown but Vincent rescues him and swims them both back to shore.On the day of the launch Jerome reveals that he has stored enough DNA samples for Vincent to last two lifetimes upon his return and gives him an envelope to open once in flight. After saying goodbye to Irene Vincent prepares to board but discovers there is a final genetic test and he currently lacks any of Jerome's samples. He is surprised when Dr. Lamar who oversees background checks reveals that he knows Vincent has been posing as a valid. Lamar admits that his son looks up to Vincent and wonders whether his son genetically selected but not all that they promised could exceed his potential just as Vincent has. The doctor changes the test results allowing Vincent to pass. As the rocket launches Jerome dons his swimming medal and immolates himself in his home's incinerator; Vincent opens the note from Jerome to find only a lock of Jerome's hair. As the movie ends Vincent muses that For someone who was never meant for this world I must confess I'm suddenly having a hard time leaving it. Of course they say every atom in our bodies was once a part of a star. Maybe I'm not leaving; maybe I'm going home.
7473,The 6th Day,At some point in the indeterminate near future the cloning of animals and human organs has become routine.  Cloning entire humans however is prohibited by what are known as Sixth Day laws.Billionaire Michael Drucker owner of cloning corporation Replacement Technologies hires charter pilot Adam Gibson and partner Hank Morgan for a ski trip. Due to Drucker's prominence the two must first undergo blood and eye tests to verify their aptitude. On the day of Drucker's arrival Adam finds that his family dog Oliver has died and Hank offers to pose as him to fly Drucker instead to allow Adam time to have the pet cloned by RePet. After visiting a RePet shop he remains unconvinced and purchases an animatronic doll a SimPal named Cindy instead. On the ski trip however Drucker and Hank are shot by one of the skiers.Adam returns home and discovers that not only has Oliver already been cloned but a purported clone of himself is with his family along with another SimPal Cindy. Replacement Technologies security agents Marshall Talia Vincent and Wiley arrive with the intention of killing Adam. Adam kills Talia and Wiley in the ensuing chase and escapes but both are later cloned. Adam goes to the police but they do not believe his story as the clone already reported his car stolen and deem him insane. They call the security agents but he escapes and seeks refuge at an alive Hank's apartment. Hank hardly believes his story but when he shows him the clone Adam he helps him. Adam contemplates killing his clone but finds himself unable to do it and they return to Hank's apartment where they are ambushed by Tripp the skier who shot Drucker and Hank. Tripp shoots and kills Hank but is mortally injured by Adam. Revealed as a religious anti-cloning extremist Tripp informs Adam that Hank was a clone since he killed the original one on the mountaintop earlier that day to be able to kill Drucker who was also a clone and there is now a new Drucker clone. Marshall and the other agents arrive on the scene and Tripp informs Adam that he gained his information from informants that work in the cloning laboratory and that he knows their identities. Tripp then commits suicide by shooting himself in the head to avoid being captured by Marshall and the others in order to prevent his memory from being scanned. The agents begin to attack Adam but he is able to disable Marshall and Talia again and steals Talia's thumb.Seeking answers Adam sneaks into Replacement Technologies with Talia's thumb and finds Dr. Griffin Weir the scientist behind Drucker's illegal human-cloning technology. Weir confirms Tripp's information about the cloning adding that to resurrect Drucker the incident had to be covered up and Adam was cloned because they mistakenly believed he had been killed when he and Hank switched places which they discovered only later and had Hank cloned as well which is also why the agents are trying to kill Adam. Weir explains that Drucker – who already died years before – could lose all of his assets if the revelation became public since clones are devoid of all rights. Sympathetic with Adam's plight Weir gives him a memory disk (syncording) of the Drucker clone but warns him that Drucker may go after the other Adam instead putting Adam's family in danger. Weir also discovers that Drucker has been engineering cloned humans with fatal diseases as an insurance policy against betrayal. Upon finding out that his own wife was one such victim Weir confronts Drucker and resigns. Drucker shoots him dead declaring that he will clone both him and his wife.Drucker's agents abduct the Gibson family during Adam's daughters school recital and Adam comes face-to-face with his clone. The two reluctantly team up and devise a plan to destroy Drucker's facility. While Adam wrecks the security system and gets himself captured the clone sneaks in plants a bomb and rescues his family. Drucker however tells Adam that he himself is the clone; the other Adam is the original one. Initially doubtful Drucker proves that Adam is the clone by showing hidden physical changes below the eye marking how many times somebody has been cloned. Enraged Adam fights off Drucker's agents and Drucker is mortally wounded while Talia Wiley Vincent and Marshall are killed for the final time. Drucker manages to clone himself before he dies but the malfunctioning equipment causes the new Drucker clone to be incomplete and extremely deformed. As the cloned Adam fights his way to the rooftop he is rescued via helicopter by the real Adam as Drucker falls to his death before the facility explodes.Now having a more moderate view of cloning the real Adam arranges for his clone to move to Argentina to start a satellite office of their charter business. The clone's existence is kept a secret especially upon discovering that his DNA has no embedded illnesses giving him a chance at a full life since he was of no political value to Drucker. As a parting gift to the Gibson family the clone gives them Hank's RePet cat Sadie. The real Adam gives the clone a flying send-off.

7502,Baby Geniuses,Two scientists Dr. Elena Kinder (Kathleen Turner) and Dr. Heep (Christopher Lloyd) use genius-baby studies to fund BabyCo's theme park Joyworld. According to Dr. Kinder's research on toddlers/babies babies are born possessing vast universal knowledge and speak a secret yet impossible-to-translate baby pre-language called Babytalk. However at age 2–3 the knowledge and language are lost as the babies cross over by learning how to speak human languages. All babies raised in Dr. Kinder's underground research facility were adopted from the orphanages Babyco supports (As they serve to filter out which babies should be raised under the Kinder Method and which babies shouldn't be raised under the Kinder Method) and transformed into small geniuses through use of the Kinder Method and then used in experiments to decipher this secret yet impossible-to-translate language used by the eight baby geniuses.One mischievous toddler Sylvester (the only one of her toddlers raised via use of the superior version of the Kinder Method) nicknamed Sly makes repeated attempts to escape Dr. Kinder's research facility. One night Sylvester goes into a diaper truck and succeeds. The next morning he is surprised to run into his long-lost normal twin brother Whit in a Joyworld playground. Although Sylvester and Whit share a telepathic bond each has no idea of the other's existence. The guards from Dr. Kinder's research facility capture Whit mistaking him for Sylvester and take him back to Dr. Kinder's research facility. Sylvester is taken home by Whit's adopted mother Robin (Kim Cattrall) who is Dr. Kinder's niece. Dr. Kinder and the seven other baby-geniuses are shocked that Whit and Sylvester switched places at the mall but Dr. Kinder becomes excited and begins to see this as an opportunity to do a cross evaluation on the twins. However when she comes to Dan Bobbin's (Peter MacNicol) place she realizes that Dan can understand babies. After the attempts to retrieve Sylvester fail Dr. Kinder decides to move the research facility to Liechtenstein and they have no choice but to make Whit be the only normal baby to be raised in this research facility until they can find a possible way to get Sylvester back to her research facility.The babies at Bobbin's place hypnotize Lenny (Dom DeLuise) the bus driver to drive to Dr. Kinder's research facility. Once at the research facility Sylvester goes to the control room to set the robots from the theme park on the lab scientists. When the Bobbins return home their natural daughter Carrie tells her father that the children are in Dr. Kinder's research facility. At the end of the fight Dr. Kinder captures Whit and takes him to the helicopter pad on the roof. Robin and Dan chase them to the roof where Dr. Kinder reveals that she and Robin are not related and that Robin was adopted at age 2. After Dr. Kinder is arrested by the police Sylvester and Whit come together on the roof to cross over.Dan and Robin adopt Sylvester. Dan is still curious of the secrets of life; but as the twins have crossed over they no longer know those secrets. Carrie their sister doesn't reveal anything (just giving her father a Sly smile) because adults are never meant to know their secrets.

After his girlfriend Samantha dumps him for being emotionally shut off his neighbor and childhood buddy Gordo comes over for supper and finds a Heathkit single-sideband ham radio that once belonged to Frank but fails to get it working.The night before the anniversary of his father's death John is surprised to find the radio operating during a particularly intense occurrence of the aurora borealis and has a brief conversation with another man concerning the 1969 World Series which John is able to recount in specific detail. Eventually he realizes that the other man is his father broadcasting in 1969 and tries to warn him of his impending death. The next day while attempting to rescue a young girl from a burning warehouse Frank remembers John's warning and carries the girl to safety. In 1999 everyone has an altered set of memories brought about by Frank's survival but only John simultaneously remembers his father dying in the fire. That evening Frank and John reconnect and learn a great deal about each other's lives.Subsequently John begins to notice major changes in the present: his mother Julia no longer lives at her current address Samantha does not recognize him and he learns that although Frank survived the fire he died in 1989 from lung cancer due to his persistent smoking. His boss Sgt. Satch DeLeon an old friend of Frank's assigns him to investigate the Nightingale a serial killer who murdered three nurses in the 1960s and was never caught. However John discovers that the Nightingale is now connected to ten murders including that of his mother Julia two weeks after the warehouse fire. Feeling guilty that their actions somehow led to the Nightingale committing more murders John persuades his father to help him prevent these crimes from occurring. Frank manages to save the first victim. But when he tries to rescue the second the Nightingale subdues him steals his driver's license and plants it on the victim to frame Frank for the murder.When Frank shares his experience with his son John realizes Frank's wallet has the Nightingale's fingerprints. John asks his father to hide the wallet  somewhere in the house where John can find it 30 years later. Using the preserved fingerprints from the wallet John identifies the Nightingale as Jack Shepard a former detective. In the original timeline Shepard died from a medical error the same night Frank died because Julia the nurse on duty had left early after learning of Frank's death and was not there to prevent the error that killed Shepard. John also learns that Shepard raped and murdered his own mother whom John had originally met alive while investigating the dug up body of one of his victims.Meanwhile in 1969 then-Detective Satch DeLeon tries to arrest Frank on suspicion of murder; he resists and the radio is knocked over and damaged.

While awaiting questioning Frank activates the precinct's fire sprinkler system escapes and breaks into Shepard's apartment where he finds jewelry taken from the victims. Shepard catches Frank in the act and pursues him ending with a fight underwater where Frank appears to have killed Shepard. Satch having realized that Frank was telling the truth arrives at Shepard's apartment in time to witness the aftermath of the struggle and find the victims' jewelry exonerating Frank.Frank fixes the radio but while talking both he and John are attacked by the 1969 and 1999 versions of Shepard. Using a shotgun Frank blows off Shepard's right hand in 1969 and Shepard flees. In 1999 as the changes in the past affect the present Shepard's hand disappears just as he is about to kill John. Furnishings in the house change as the timeline rapidly updates itself in 1999. An elderly Frank having quit smoking to avoid his cancer-related death in 1989 appears and kills Shepard with the same shotgun and embraces his son.The film concludes with a softball game including John Samantha (now his wife) John's young son Frank Julia Satch and Gordo. In 1969 as a child Gordo had talked briefly over the radio to John in 1999; John told him to pay attention to Yahoo. At the baseball game the license plate of Gordo's expensive car is seen to bear the word Yahoo!.
7531,A Scanner Darkly,The United States has lost the war on drugs. Substance D a powerful drug that causes bizarre hallucinations has swept the country. Approximately 20% of the total population is addicted. In response the government has developed an invasive high-tech surveillance system and a network of undercover officers and informants.Bob Arctor is one of these undercover agents assigned to immerse himself in the drug's underworld and infiltrate up the supply chain. Arctor has a vision of being in his house with a wife and two children in Anaheim California; today he has two drug-addicted layabout housemates: Luckman and Barris. The three spend time taking D and having complex possibly paranoiac examinations of their experiences. At the police station Arctor maintains privacy by wearing a scramble suit that constantly changes every aspect of his appearance and voice; he is known only by the code name Fred. Arctor's senior officer Hank and all other undercover officers also wear scramble suits protecting their identities even from each other.Since going undercover Arctor himself has become addicted to Substance D and buys from Donna who Arctor hopes to purchase large enough quantities of D from so that she is forced to introduce him to her own supplier. They have a tense at times caring romantic relationship but she rebuffs his physical advances.At work Hank orders Fred to increase surveillance on Arctor himself and his associates. Arctor's house is now at the center of his own investigation since this is where Donna and the other addicts spend time. Arctor is inexpertly negotiating a double life and his prolonged use of D is damaging his brain. Barris is informing on Arctor to Hank arguing that Arctor is a terrorist and angling to be hired as a cop himself. However Barris unknowingly conveys this information in the presence of Arctor himself whose identity at the time is hidden behind his scramble suit.Hank reveals to Fred that he has long known that he is Arctor. Arctor seems legitimately surprised and repeats his own name in a disoriented unfamiliar tone. Hank informs him that the real purpose of the surveillance was to catch Barris and that the police were deliberately increasing Barris's paranoia until he attempted to cover his tracks. Hank reprimands Arctor for becoming addicted to Substance D and warns him that he will be disciplined. Hank explains how seriously brain damaged Arctor has become from D and Hank phones Donna asking her to come pick up Arctor and take him to New-Path a corporation that runs a series of rehabilitation clinics. Hank immediately leaves and in private removes his scramble suit revealing Donna. At the New-Path clinic Arctor and other D addicts show serious cognitive deficiencies.Donna now known as Audrey meets with Mike a fellow police officer. They discuss how New-Path is secretly responsible for the manufacture and distribution of Substance D. Audrey expresses her growing ethical aversion to their police work in which they deliberately recruited Arctor — without his knowledge — to become addicted to D; his health sacrificed so that he might eventually enter a New-Path rehabilitation center unnoticed as a genuine addict and collect incriminating evidence of New-Path's D farms. Audrey and Mike debate whether Arctor's mind will recover enough to grasp the situation.New-Path sends Arctor to a labor camp at an isolated farm where he mindlessly repeats what others tells him. Tending to corn crops Arctor discovers hidden rows of the blue flowers that produce D. He secretly hides one flower in his boot to bring to his friends at his next holiday from the farm.

Hogarth eventually befriends the Giant finding him docile and curious. When he eats railroad tracks in the path of an oncoming train the train collides with him and derails; Hogarth leads the Giant away from the area discovering that he can self-repair. While there Hogarth shows the Giant comic books and compares him to the hero Superman.The incidents lead a xenophobic U.S. government agent named Kent Mansley to Rockwell. He suspects Hogarth's involvement after talking with him and his widowed mother Annie (Hogarth's father was a U.S. Air Force pilot who died during the Korean War) and rents a room in their house to keep an eye on him. Hogarth evades Mansley and leads the Giant to a junkyard owned by beatnik artist Dean McCoppin who reluctantly agrees to keep him. Hogarth enjoys his time with the Giant but is compelled to explain the concept of death to the Giant after he witnesses hunters killing a deer.That night the Giant has a vision of his past life being one of many alien extermination weapons which Dean sees through the TV. Hogarth is interrogated by Mansley when he discovers evidence of the Giant after finding a photo of him next to Hogarth and brings a U.S. Army contingent led by General Rogard to the scrapyard to prove the Giant's existence but Dean (having been warned by Hogarth earlier) tricks them by pretending that the Giant is one of his art pieces.Upset by the apparent false alarm Rogard prepares to leave with his forces after berating Mansley for his actions. Hogarth then continues to have fun with the Giant by playing with a toy gun but inadvertently activates the Giant's defensive system; Dean yells at him for nearly killing Hogarth and the saddened Giant runs away with Hogarth giving chase. Dean quickly realizes that the Giant was only acting in self-defense and catches up to Hogarth as they follow the Giant.The Giant saves two boys falling from a roof when he arrives winning over the townspeople. Mansley spots the Giant in the town while leaving Rockwell and stops the Army sending them to attack the Giant after he has picked up Hogarth forcing the two to flee together. They initially evade the military by using the Giant's flight system but the Giant is then shot down and crashes to the ground.Hogarth is knocked unconscious but the Giant thinking that Hogarth is dead completely gives in to his defensive system in a fit of rage and grief and attacks the military in retaliation transforming into a war machine and making its way back to Rockwell. Mansley convinces Rogard to prepare a nuclear missile launch from the USS Nautilus as conventional weapons prove to be ineffective. Hogarth awakens and returns in time to calm the Giant while Dean clarifies the situation to Rogard.The General is ready to stand down and order the Nautilus to deactivate its primed nuke when Mansley impulsively orders the missile launch in a fit of paranoia causing the missile to head towards Rockwell where it will destroy the town and its population upon impact in the resulting nuclear detonation. Mansley attempts to escape after being given a furious scolding by Rogard but the Giant stops him and Rogard has Mansley arrested and orders his men to make sure he stays there like a good soldier. In order to save the town the Giant bids farewell to Hogarth and flies off to intercept the missile. As he soars directly into the path of the missile the Giant remembers Hogarth's words You are who you choose to be smiles contentedly and says Superman as he collides with the weapon. The missile explodes in the atmosphere saving Rockwell its population and the military forces nearby but seemingly at the cost of the Giant himself leaving Hogarth devastated.Months later a memorial of the Giant stands in Rockwell. Dean and Annie begin a relationship. Hogarth is given a package from Rogard containing a screw from the Giant which is the only remnant found. That night Hogarth finds the screw trying to move on its own and remembering the Giant's ability to self-repair happily allows the screw to leave.The screw joins many other parts as they converge on the Giant's head on the Langjökull glacier in Iceland and the Giant smiles as he begins reassembling himself.

8727,Universal Soldier: The Return,At least 15 years after the events in the first film former UniSol Luc Deveraux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) has been reverted to normal via genetic procedures. He currently works as a technical expert for the U.S. government with his new partner Maggie (Kiana Tom) who has been through countless hours of combat training with him. They worked to refine and perfect the UniSol Program in an effort to make a new stronger breed of soldiers that are more sophisticated and intelligent to reduce the use of normal human soldiers in the battlefield. All of the new UniSols known as UniSols 2500 which are faster and stronger than the original UniSols are connected via neural implants through a sentient artificially intelligent computer system called S.E.T.H. (Self-Evolving Thought Helix).When S.E.T.H. discovers that the UniSol Program is scheduled to be shut down because of budget cuts he finds this to be a disgrace and decides to take action by formulating a plot to overthrow the humans and take over the world with his own massive army of UniSols. The next day S.E.T.H. unleashes a platoon of UniSols led by the musclebound Romeo (Bill Goldberg) in a hostile takeover of the UniSol building resulting in the deaths of many occupants including Dr. Dylan Cotner (Xander Berkeley) who is responsible for reverting Luc back to normal. As such Luc Maggie and the others are forced to evacuate. With the help of a rogue cyberpunk named Squid (Brent Hinkley) S.E.T.H. is able to put himself in a UniSol body (Michael Jai White) superior to others. In the meantime Maggie noticed that Luc's daughter Hillary Deveraux (Karis Paige Bryant) has suffered a brain swelling after almost being attacked by Romeo and takes her to the local hospital.Luc attempts to find a way to shut down S.E.T.H. with the help from ambitious reporter Erin Young (Heidi Schanz) whose cameraman died in the massacre. General Radford (Daniel von Bargen) wants to take extreme measures to stop S.E.T.H. by sending in troops but most of the troops (alongside a TV reporter and her crew) were massacred by four UniSols; even when Luc briefly tried to lead a team of United States Army Rangers commandeered by Captain Blackburn (Justin Lazard) and Sergeant Morrow (James R. Black) most of the Rangers (including Blackburn and Morrow) are killed when a UniSol sentry sees them sneaking into the building.Luc and Erin then track down Squid after learning that he was a former member of the UniSol Program but S.E.T.H. arrives and kills Squid revealing an ultimatum to Luc: he must give up the secret code that is needed to deactivate a built-in program that will shut S.E.T.H. down in a matter of hours so that no one will stop him. To ensure that Luc would cooperate a departing S.E.T.H. got Romeo to track down Hillary at the hospital and S.E.T.H. kidnaps Hillary while Romeo kills Maggie and several hospital guards. Upon returning to the UniSol building S.E.T.H. deactivated a time bomb implanted by Radford to prevent the UniSol building from being destroyed much to Radford's outrage.Having no other choice Luc returns to the UniSol building again and takes down many UniSols right before learning that Maggie has been revived as a UniSol. He also learns that S.E.T.H. is healing Hillary with UniSol technology and upon receiving the code S.E.T.H. decides to kill Luc and turn Hillary into a UniSol so that he can raise her as his own daughter. Eventually Luc destroys S.E.T.H. by shattering his body to pieces in liquid nitrogen but the remaining UniSols are still active; even Romeo catches and defeats Luc in combat intending to kill him and Hillary and lead the remaining UniSols into battle. However Maggie (who has been freed due to S.E.T.H.'s demise) shoots Romeo and allows Luc and Hillary to leave asking Luc to blow up the building with herself Romeo and the remaining UniSols inside as she refuses to live the rest of her life as a UniSol. Luc reluctantly obliged to Maggie's wishes by setting off the time bomb to destroy the building killing the remaining UniSols for good. Luc then reunites with Erin and Hillary satisfied that they have put an end to S.E.T.H.'s plot and avenged their loved ones.
